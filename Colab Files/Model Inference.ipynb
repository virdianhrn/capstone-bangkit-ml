This means that, for example, when you call an operation like tf.matMul(a, b), it will block the main thread until the operation has completed. For this reason, the bindings are well suited for scripts and offline tasks. If you want to use the Node.js bindings in a production application like a web server, you should set up a job queue or set up worker threads so your TensorFlow.js code doesn't block the main
