En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi. Pengumuman ini disampaikan langsung oleh sang kreator, Dan Salvato melalui akun twitter resminya.

Dan Salvato menjelaskan bahwa DDLC+ akan membawa berbagai konten baru meliputi side stories, yakni cerita sampingan yang menjelaskan bagaimana persahabatan dari para heroine di klub literatur terbentuk. Side stories sendiri akan terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan. Artwork dari side stories sendiri dikerjakan oleh ilustrator LucidSky dan SquChan, serta VelinquenT sebagai ilustrator latar belakang.

Selanjutnya adalah in-built music player yang terdiri dari 26 trek lagu, meliputi 13 lagu orisinal, side stories, serta guest tracks dari Jason Hayes, sang komposer dari game World of Warcraft.

Lalu yang terakhir adalah art gallery, yang meliputi lebih dari 100 artwork dan wallpaper dalam game termasuk sketsa konsep yang belum pernah dirilis sebelumnya oleh Team Salvato.

DDLC+ akan dirilis pada tanggal 30 Juni mendatang untuk platform PlayStation, Xbox, PC, dan Nintendo Switch. DDLC+ sendiri tersedia dalam dua varian, yakni versi digital dan versi fisik yang lengkap dengan berbagai merchandise dari franchise DDLC, tersedia untuk PlayStation dan Switch.

Versi digital sendiri akan dibanderol seharga $15 (213 ribu Rupiah) dan versi fisik edisi spesial seharga $30 (426 ribu Rupiah). Untuk pre-ordernya sendiri dapat dilakukan di Serenity Forge Store melalui link disini.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka. Game ini punya tema berat mengenai kesehatan mental di samping mempertontonkan para ""waifu"" yang kita pilih.

Para penggemar juga bisa berharap lebih jika Dan Salvato memutuskan untuk menghadirkan spin-off. Bisa jadi, ada gameplay baru yang bakal diusung sama sang pembuat game dewasa ini. Apakah kalian bisa membayangkan jika Doki Doki Literature Club memakai gaya role playing game atau RPG dengan pilihan para waifu sebagai karakter permainan?

Buat kalian yang menunggu, tampaknya berita kedatangan episode atau game baru Doki Doki Literature Club masih cukup lama. Pasalnya, Dan Salvato baru merencanakan pengembangan saja. Tentunya butuh waktu pengembangan yang cukup lama jika dirinya ingin menelurkan game baru.

Apakah kalian juga sempat memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club? Jangan sungkan untuk bagikan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar bawah, ya! Terus ikutin juga berita game dan tulisan menarik lainnya hanya di KINCIR.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

Born Brazilian, raised Canadian, Luiz is a writer and Film student that spends most of his time watching movies and subsequently complaining about them.

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi. Pengumuman ini disampaikan langsung oleh sang kreator, Dan Salvato melalui akun twitter resminya.

I'm delighted to announce Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, a labor of love from @TeamSalvato and @SerenityForge. #DDLCPlus includes new features and content and releases June 30th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox. https://t.co/iRWD66q98EInfo in thread! pic.twitter.com/4I2hnDA2j7

Dan Salvato menjelaskan bahwa DDLC+ akan membawa berbagai konten baru meliputi side stories, yakni cerita sampingan yang menjelaskan bagaimana persahabatan dari para heroine di klub literatur terbentuk. Side stories sendiri akan terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

“True Detective: Night Country” Official Trailer – Jodie Foster Hunts a Killer in the Arctic This January

‘Devils’ – Acclaimed Body-Swap Thriller in the Vein of ‘Face/Off’ Heading to SCREAMBOX Tomorrow! [Trailer]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

Born Brazilian, raised Canadian, Luiz is a writer and Film student that spends most of his time watching movies and subsequently complaining about them.

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka. Game ini punya tema berat mengenai kesehatan mental di samping mempertontonkan para ""waifu"" yang kita pilih.

Para penggemar juga bisa berharap lebih jika Dan Salvato memutuskan untuk menghadirkan spin-off. Bisa jadi, ada gameplay baru yang bakal diusung sama sang pembuat game dewasa ini. Apakah kalian bisa membayangkan jika Doki Doki Literature Club memakai gaya role playing game atau RPG dengan pilihan para waifu sebagai karakter permainan?

Buat kalian yang menunggu, tampaknya berita kedatangan episode atau game baru Doki Doki Literature Club masih cukup lama. Pasalnya, Dan Salvato baru merencanakan pengembangan saja. Tentunya butuh waktu pengembangan yang cukup lama jika dirinya ingin menelurkan game baru.

Apakah kalian juga sempat memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club? Jangan sungkan untuk bagikan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar bawah, ya! Terus ikutin juga berita game dan tulisan menarik lainnya hanya di KINCIR.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

Born Brazilian, raised Canadian, Luiz is a writer and Film student that spends most of his time watching movies and subsequently complaining about them.

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi. Pengumuman ini disampaikan langsung oleh sang kreator, Dan Salvato melalui akun twitter resminya.

I'm delighted to announce Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, a labor of love from @TeamSalvato and @SerenityForge. #DDLCPlus includes new features and content and releases June 30th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox. https://t.co/iRWD66q98EInfo in thread! pic.twitter.com/4I2hnDA2j7

Dan Salvato menjelaskan bahwa DDLC+ akan membawa berbagai konten baru meliputi side stories, yakni cerita sampingan yang menjelaskan bagaimana persahabatan dari para heroine di klub literatur terbentuk. Side stories sendiri akan terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan. Artwork dari side stories sendiri dikerjakan oleh ilustrator LucidSky dan SquChan, serta VelinquenT sebagai ilustrator latar belakang.

Selanjutnya adalah in-built music player yang terdiri dari 26 trek lagu, meliputi 13 lagu orisinal, side stories, serta guest tracks dari Jason Hayes, sang komposer dari game World of Warcraft.

Lalu yang terakhir adalah art gallery, yang meliputi lebih dari 100 artwork dan wallpaper dalam game termasuk sketsa konsep yang belum pernah dirilis sebelumnya oleh Team Salvato.

DDLC+ akan dirilis pada tanggal 30 Juni mendatang untuk platform PlayStation, Xbox, PC, dan Nintendo Switch. DDLC+ sendiri tersedia dalam dua varian, yakni versi digital dan versi fisik yang lengkap dengan berbagai merchandise dari franchise DDLC, tersedia untuk PlayStation dan Switch.

Versi digital sendiri akan dibanderol seharga $15 (213 ribu Rupiah) dan versi fisik edisi spesial seharga $30 (426 ribu Rupiah). Untuk pre-ordernya sendiri dapat dilakukan di Serenity Forge Store melalui link disini.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka. Game ini punya tema berat mengenai kesehatan mental di samping mempertontonkan para ""waifu"" yang kita pilih.

Para penggemar juga bisa berharap lebih jika Dan Salvato memutuskan untuk menghadirkan spin-off. Bisa jadi, ada gameplay baru yang bakal diusung sama sang pembuat game dewasa ini. Apakah kalian bisa membayangkan jika Doki Doki Literature Club memakai gaya role playing game atau RPG dengan pilihan para waifu sebagai karakter permainan?

Buat kalian yang menunggu, tampaknya berita kedatangan episode atau game baru Doki Doki Literature Club masih cukup lama. Pasalnya, Dan Salvato baru merencanakan pengembangan saja. Tentunya butuh waktu pengembangan yang cukup lama jika dirinya ingin menelurkan game baru.

Apakah kalian juga sempat memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club? Jangan sungkan untuk bagikan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar bawah, ya! Terus ikutin juga berita game dan tulisan menarik lainnya hanya di KINCIR.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

"10 Game Anime Terbaik di Steam, Gamer Wajib Coba",detikInet,5 bulan lalu,https://inet.detik.com/games-features/d-6776658/10-game-anime-terbaik-di-steam-gamer-wajib-coba,"Anime memang menjadi salah satu hiburan yang begitu populer dan punya banyak peminat. Oleh sebab itu, tidak sedikit developer game yang memanfaatkan eksistensinya itu.

Mereka berbondong-bondong, menciptakan permainan yang terinspirasi dari jalan cerita maupun tokoh-tokoh di dalamnya. Entah apa tujuannya, tapi bagi sebagian orang, pasti berpikir bahwa para developer mencoba menggaet pemain baru dari penggemar anime.

Nah berangkat dari hal tersebut, inilah sejumlah game anime terbaik yang bisa dinikmati di Steam. Mari simak penjelasan singkatnya, seperti dihimpun dari The Gamer.

Bagi para penggemar anime garis keras, siapa sih yang tidak tahu soal Naruto. Perjuangan seorang anak dalam upaya menjadi Hokage ini, mampu menyentuh hati para penontonnya.

Kini para pecinta Naruto bisa kembali bernostalgia, melalui game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. Sejak rilis di Steam tahun 2016, game ini mampu mendapatkan apresiasi luar biasa dari penikmatnya.

Hingga saat ini, gamer pasti mengetahui betul bahwa Final Fantasy menjadi seri terbesar Square Enix. Mengusung permainan Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), pemain bisa menjelajahi dunia Hydaelyn.

Di sini kalian dapat memilih karakter dari ras, jenis kelamin, dan kelas apa saja. Seperti MMORPG pada umumnya, gamer harus menyelesaikan misi cerita utama, sampingan, menjelajahi dungeon, dan membunuh monster untuk meningkatkan level karakter.

Jika ingin merasakan gameplay berbeda dari game anime terbaik di Steam, bisa mencoba Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy. Hanya saja tidak semua orang bisa menerima game jenis ini.

Maklum kebanyakan lebih suka pertempuran intens dan adu jotos yang super epik. Kendati begitu, game novel visual yang satu ini patut dimainkan.

Bila gamer mencari tantangan yang menampilkan aksi dengan elemen RPG dan binatang buas, bisa banget main Monster Hunter Rise. Pengembang sudah menyiapkan tampilan visual luar biasa, yang mampu memanjakan mata pemainnya.

Tugas utama di dalam game ini ialah melindungi desa dari serangan monster. Tidak perlu takut menghadapinya, karena detikers dibekali senjata yang cukup kuat untuk menghabisi semua masalah itu.

Dari seluruh game yang ada di Steam, yang punya premis menarik dan unik salah satunya bisa didapatkan dari Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.

Di dalam permainan, ada beruang pembunuh yang dikenal sebagai Monokuma, telah menyebabkan pertentangan di antara para siswa. Tugas gamer ialah mencari tahu pelaku di balik setiap masalah.

Yu-Gi-Oh! menjadi permainan yang sudah sangat populer sejak tahun 2000-an. Bukan hanya animenya saja, tetapi itu berlaku juga untuk video game-nya.

Sekarang pemain dihadapkan dengan seri terbaru, yang memiliki visual lebih epik. Jika penasaran dengan tampilan anyarnya, Konami menawarkan Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel secara gratis.

Berikutnya ada NieR: Automata dari Square Enix. Rilis sejak tahun 2017 di Steam, pengembang membanderolnya seharga Rp 579 ribu.

Harganya bisa dibilang memang cukup mahal. Namun tidak perlu ragu dengan mekanik permainan di dalamnya, karena bisa memberikan keseruan yang membuat gamer ketagihan.

Game anime terbaik di Steam yang terakhir ialah Doki Doki Literature Club! Sekilas game ini tentang gadis-gadis yang imut dan menggemaskan.

Namun seiring dengan berjalannya cerita, akan ada perubahan besar. Di dalamnya ada sensasi horor yang dibalut dengan topik sensitif, seperti depresi, bunuh diri, atau menyakiti diri sendiri.

Music In The Key of Parenthood,KQED,4 minggu lalu,https://www.kqed.org/arts/13937745/songs-in-the-key-of-parenthood,"View the full episode transcript.
Most parents have a story about their kid and music. Maybe there’s footage of an embarrassing singing performance or video of an entertaining dance rendition. Either way, I’m sure it’s a worthwhile tale where lessons were learned. And that’s because music, one of the highest forms of art, is also one of the greatest teaching tools.
My daughter and I discuss music from the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, that’s because I’m always playing music. I’m raising her that way, largely because that’s how I grew up.
My mother’s love for funk and R&B, as well as new jack swing and hip-hop, laid the foundation for my musical pallet. Now that I’m raising my own little one, I’ve built on the foundation I had as a kid and I’m passing all of that musical knowledge down, song by song.
In return, my daughter is teaching me some things I need to know about tunes we listen to on a daily basis. This interaction is a reminder: not only is music a great teaching tool, but the lessons go both ways.
On this week’s podcast, we discuss how my daughter and I bond over music, especially while taking trips in the car. It’s a joyride every time!


Episode Transcript
Pendarvis Harshaw: Growing up, music was always playing in my house. 
[Music playing]
We had the big wicker covered speakers with the red, white and yellow RCA cables connected to an amplifier. The dual tape players and the multiple disc changer was where music lived. 
Prince and Teena Marie were constant. Earth, Wind, and Fire was always in rotation. The soundtracks for movies like The Bodyguard and Crooklyn were staples. 
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw: Moms even got into New Jack Swing and eventually hip-hop. She loved the group Arrested Development, and because of that, I did too. 
And now I’m raising my daughter the same way. But uh, slightly remixed. 
It’s Golden Era hip-hop in the morning. Fela in the afternoon. Sade after dinner. Miles Davis at midnight. Or maybe it’s Kaytranda in the morning. Sublime in the midday. Rihanna during the afterschool drive, and then a mix of Japanese Jazz Fusion artists as we read and get ready for bed in the evening. 
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw: Even though the genres have slightly expanded from how I was raised, my daughter is soaking it all up all the same.
Zuri: Hi, I’m Zuri and I’m seven years old. 
Pendarvis Harshaw: We talk about how music is subtle and ubiquitous, playing at the grocery store or in the background of a TV show. And, at the same time, music is a magical artform that takes listeners into a world of different emotional responses. 
I’m waxing poetically, but I’m no musician. Far from it. I tried rapping when I was a teen, but I forgot my lyrics. Tried singing but my voice changed; now I couldn’t hold a note even if I had special note-holding-gloves. 
But I’m a student of music, and I attribute that to being raised in a house where music was always playing– and in that, I was always learning, because music is one hell of a teaching tool.  
Today on the show, I want to share with you some of things that I’ve learned along the way, right after this.  
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  One weekend, I was driving around with my daughter Zuri, looking for something with a funky bassline for our sunny Saturday drive. My aim was to find some music with kid-friendly lyrics, but not too “kiddie,” because it was my Saturday too. 
I landed on Zapp and Roger, their greatest hits. 
A few seconds into the first track my daughter asked me:
Zuri: Are these the guys who make music with the tubes in their mouth?
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  Yes! She remembered. 
The next step is remembering the artists’ actual names, and then maybe the instrument– a voice box, autotune or even more broadly, a synthesizer. But she remembered something, so I was juiced!
I played another track by Zapp and Roger, and then she followed up
Zuri: Do all of their songs sound like this?
Pendarvis Harshaw:  Well, no. They have this one song I really like…
[Music playing] 
Pendarvis Harshaw:  Within the first few beats of the song, she blurts out:
Zuri: Tupac!
Pendarvis Harshaw: YES! That’s it! That’s the song Tupac sampled for “Keep Your Head Up”. Bruh, I was ecstatic!
Posted at the red light, I got a lil choked up– I looked out the window pretending something caught my attention, holding back a lil tear.
My approach to musicology was working… And then I got greedy.  
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  I tried to explain to her that in the song “Keep Your Head Up,” Tupac’s producer, DJ Daryl, sampled the melody of the Zapp’s “Be Alright,” but the lyrics of Tupac’s song were a reference to another classic track. 
[Music playing] 
Pendarvis Harshaw: He was inspired by a group called The Five Stairsteps, who had a song called, “O-H-H-Child.” 
We got about thirty seconds into the song, when she asked me to turn down the music and said:
Zuri: Daddy, this sounds like the chipmunks. 
Pendarvis Harshaw:  I didn’t see that coming. But that’s what happens when we talk about music in the car: There’s always something new. 
The conversations touch on history and spirituality, sexism and racism. There’s almost always a tie in to Oakland. And just about every time she asks me about an artist, she asks if they’re still alive– which made me realize just how often I listen to recordings of people who are in the realm of the ancestors. 
And of course, as when talking to just about any kid, there’s jokes. Like that one time she put in a request from the backseat… 
[Music playing]
Zuri: Daddy, can you play that one Michael Jackson song, “BLT”??? 
Pendarvis Harshaw: She’s not just learning from me, she’s getting it while she’s at school, by attending extracurricular programs, and when she’s at her mom’s house.
 One week, I thought I was cool by showing her the version of the story of Cinderella starring Brandy. As soon the film started she was like… 
Zuri: Daddy, is that Moesha? 
Pendarvis Harshaw:  Her mom introduced her to both Moesha and Brandy, got her a Whitney Houston t-shirt, and helped her with her school project about Aretha Franklin. 
They also often watch “The Masked Singer”. Now, she knows Motown hits, but has a hard time believing Smokey Robinson wrote ‘em, instead of a person wearing an owl costume. 
 [Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  The best part of this journey through musical education: it works both ways! Now she’s teaching me about music. 
One spicy summer afternoon in Sacramento, my daughter and her friends gathered out front of our apartment singing their hearts out on a small Karaoke machine. 
They ran through the classics: Moana and Frozen. Then they hit some of the newer joints, like “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”– that’s the youngest kid’s favorite. 
The boy across the way, he loves “Sunflower” off the Spiderman soundtrack. And Jack Black’s “Peaches” gets everybody going.  
Then, a high schooler who lives in the apartment downstairs from me grabbed the mic and brought us into her world as she cued up this video of a rap battle between two animated characters:
It features Natsuki, from the Doki Doki Literature Club and DC Comics’ heroine, Raven. As the video played, the teenager stood on the apartment walkway spitting flames! Reciting the lyrics bar for bar! 
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw: I can only hope my daughter is that passionate about her own musical interests when she’s a teen. 
But for now, she’s in first grade. And even with this exposure to classic music and cultural icons, we still get pummeled with high-pitched voices singing overly joyous jingles. 
And through those kiddie jams, again, I find important musical lessons. 
My daughter loves this one PBS Kids show called “Hero Elementary.” It’s about a group of children who have special superpowers, but they’re still learning how to properly use them– hence the schooling. 
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw: The show’s theme song is a catchy tune, one of the many children’s songs that unfortunately gets stuck in my head and plays on repeat at the worst times– like during important meetings.
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  A few weeks ago I was up late, writing and listening to some miscellaneous jazz tunes, when I heard Michel Camilo’s 1989 song “On Fire.”
I jumped up like my daughter did when she heard the Zapp song that Tupac sampled, “Hero Elementary!” I said to myself in the living room. 
In listening to children’s song after children’s song, I’m reminded that the catchy music and melodic storytelling that works for the babies also works in grown folks’ music. 
Listen closely to songs like Tupac’s “Hail Mary” Or “Ambitionz Az A Ridah,” aside from the menacing delivery and the vulgarity, he’s reciting his lyrics like they’re a Mother Goose tale. 
My daughter and I listen to some select Tupac songs, and have discussed his impact– as well as the legacies of Amy Winehouse, Bob Marley, Aaliyah and other artists who’ve become ancestors too soon.
But it’s the Tupac songs that have brought about the best conversations. 
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw: Through them we’ve discussed oppression and liberation, Pac’s connection to Oakland and the Black Panther Party. And we’ve talked about the real meanings of the B-word and the N-word.
[Music playing]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  I’m mindful of the cuss words, as well as the sentiment in the songs I play when she’s around. I try to stay away from the R&B songs that have lyrics like “I can’t live without you,” because language about healthy relationships is just as important as learning not to cuss.
And we haven’t even gotten to the rap songs with violent lyrics, references to drugs or deep-seated misogyny. 
Besides “Getting It” I haven’t played any Short for her, nor any E-40. 
But she knows who Tupac, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube are. And at the age of seven, she can identify the voices of Erykah Badu and Stevie Wonder. 
The educational exploration of music hasn’t stopped her from learning “Baby Shark” or memorizing songs from The Little Mermaid soundtrack, she’s still very much so a kid. 
And I’m enjoying seeing her grow. I’m fortunate to have this experience. Some people don’t have the luxury of playing music constantly, or riding around discussing art with their children. Some folks aren’t even able to be with their children at all. So I don’t take this time for granted. 
[Nipsey Hussle memorial clip]
Pendarvis Harshaw:  Four years ago at the funeral for the late hip-hop legend and entrepreneur, Nipsey Hussle, his longtime girlfriend, the talented actress Lauren London, said something that I think about a lot.  
She stood behind a podium, wearing a bright white gown and dark black sunglasses, as her hair draped over her shoulders.
Speaking to the audience at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, she shared a prepared statement reflecting on what Nipsey brought to the world– and specifically their family. 
[Music playing] 
Pendarvis Harshaw: She said that Nipsey would wake up in the morning and play music for the kids, simultaneously lighting sage and burning it around the house. It was his effort to get everyone’s energy right before walking out the door. 
I think about that – as I’m lighting an incense or a candle as the sun rises, and i’m looking through my playlists trying to figure out the first song of the day. Knowing that I’m not just a dad posing as a DJ, but a human using one of the highest forms of art to lend some guidance to another human who is on their spiritual journey. 
Pendarvis Harshaw: What do you like about music?
Zuri: I like that it sounds fun and funny sometimes and it’s cool.
Pendarvis Harshaw: How does music make you feel?
Zuri:  Happy because you get to dance!

Most parents have a story about their kid and music. Maybe there’s footage of an embarrassing singing performance or video of an entertaining dance rendition. Either way, I’m sure it’s a worthwhile tale where lessons were learned. And that’s because music, one of the highest forms of art, is also one of the greatest teaching tools.

My daughter and I discuss music from the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, that’s because I’m always playing music. I’m raising her that way, largely because that’s how I grew up.

My mother’s love for funk and R&B, as well as new jack swing and hip-hop, laid the foundation for my musical pallet. Now that I’m raising my own little one, I’ve built on the foundation I had as a kid and I’m passing all of that musical knowledge down, song by song.

In return, my daughter is teaching me some things I need to know about tunes we listen to on a daily basis. This interaction is a reminder: not only is music a great teaching tool, but the lessons go both ways.

On this week’s podcast, we discuss how my daughter and I bond over music, especially while taking trips in the car. It’s a joyride every time!

We had the big wicker covered speakers with the red, white and yellow RCA cables connected to an amplifier. The dual tape players and the multiple disc changer was where music lived. 

Prince and Teena Marie were constant. Earth, Wind, and Fire was always in rotation. The soundtracks for movies like The Bodyguard and Crooklyn were staples. 

Pendarvis Harshaw: Moms even got into New Jack Swing and eventually hip-hop. She loved the group Arrested Development, and because of that, I did too. 

It’s Golden Era hip-hop in the morning. Fela in the afternoon. Sade after dinner. Miles Davis at midnight. Or maybe it’s Kaytranda in the morning. Sublime in the midday. Rihanna during the afterschool drive, and then a mix of Japanese Jazz Fusion artists as we read and get ready for bed in the evening. 

Pendarvis Harshaw: Even though the genres have slightly expanded from how I was raised, my daughter is soaking it all up all the same.

Pendarvis Harshaw: We talk about how music is subtle and ubiquitous, playing at the grocery store or in the background of a TV show. And, at the same time, music is a magical artform that takes listeners into a world of different emotional responses. 

I’m waxing poetically, but I’m no musician. Far from it. I tried rapping when I was a teen, but I forgot my lyrics. Tried singing but my voice changed; now I couldn’t hold a note even if I had special note-holding-gloves. 

But I’m a student of music, and I attribute that to being raised in a house where music was always playing– and in that, I was always learning, because music is one hell of a teaching tool.  

Today on the show, I want to share with you some of things that I’ve learned along the way, right after this.  

Pendarvis Harshaw:  One weekend, I was driving around with my daughter Zuri, looking for something with a funky bassline for our sunny Saturday drive. My aim was to find some music with kid-friendly lyrics, but not too “kiddie,” because it was my Saturday too. 

The next step is remembering the artists’ actual names, and then maybe the instrument– a voice box, autotune or even more broadly, a synthesizer. But she remembered something, so I was juiced!

Pendarvis Harshaw: YES! That’s it! That’s the song Tupac sampled for “Keep Your Head Up”. Bruh, I was ecstatic!

Posted at the red light, I got a lil choked up– I looked out the window pretending something caught my attention, holding back a lil tear.

Pendarvis Harshaw:  I tried to explain to her that in the song “Keep Your Head Up,” Tupac’s producer, DJ Daryl, sampled the melody of the Zapp’s “Be Alright,” but the lyrics of Tupac’s song were a reference to another classic track. 

Pendarvis Harshaw: He was inspired by a group called The Five Stairsteps, who had a song called, “O-H-H-Child.” 

Pendarvis Harshaw:  I didn’t see that coming. But that’s what happens when we talk about music in the car: There’s always something new. 

The conversations touch on history and spirituality, sexism and racism. There’s almost always a tie in to Oakland. And just about every time she asks me about an artist, she asks if they’re still alive– which made me realize just how often I listen to recordings of people who are in the realm of the ancestors. 

And of course, as when talking to just about any kid, there’s jokes. Like that one time she put in a request from the backseat… 

Pendarvis Harshaw: She’s not just learning from me, she’s getting it while she’s at school, by attending extracurricular programs, and when she’s at her mom’s house.

 One week, I thought I was cool by showing her the version of the story of Cinderella starring Brandy. As soon the film started she was like… 

Pendarvis Harshaw:  Her mom introduced her to both Moesha and Brandy, got her a Whitney Houston t-shirt, and helped her with her school project about Aretha Franklin. 

They also often watch “The Masked Singer”. Now, she knows Motown hits, but has a hard time believing Smokey Robinson wrote ‘em, instead of a person wearing an owl costume. 

Pendarvis Harshaw:  The best part of this journey through musical education: it works both ways! Now she’s teaching me about music. 

One spicy summer afternoon in Sacramento, my daughter and her friends gathered out front of our apartment singing their hearts out on a small Karaoke machine. 

They ran through the classics: Moana and Frozen. Then they hit some of the newer joints, like “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”– that’s the youngest kid’s favorite. 

The boy across the way, he loves “Sunflower” off the Spiderman soundtrack. And Jack Black’s “Peaches” gets everybody going.  

Then, a high schooler who lives in the apartment downstairs from me grabbed the mic and brought us into her world as she cued up this video of a rap battle between two animated characters:

It features Natsuki, from the Doki Doki Literature Club and DC Comics’ heroine, Raven. As the video played, the teenager stood on the apartment walkway spitting flames! Reciting the lyrics bar for bar! 

Pendarvis Harshaw: I can only hope my daughter is that passionate about her own musical interests when she’s a teen. 

But for now, she’s in first grade. And even with this exposure to classic music and cultural icons, we still get pummeled with high-pitched voices singing overly joyous jingles. 

My daughter loves this one PBS Kids show called “Hero Elementary.” It’s about a group of children who have special superpowers, but they’re still learning how to properly use them– hence the schooling. 

Pendarvis Harshaw: The show’s theme song is a catchy tune, one of the many children’s songs that unfortunately gets stuck in my head and plays on repeat at the worst times– like during important meetings.

Pendarvis Harshaw:  A few weeks ago I was up late, writing and listening to some miscellaneous jazz tunes, when I heard Michel Camilo’s 1989 song “On Fire.”

I jumped up like my daughter did when she heard the Zapp song that Tupac sampled, “Hero Elementary!” I said to myself in the living room. 

In listening to children’s song after children’s song, I’m reminded that the catchy music and melodic storytelling that works for the babies also works in grown folks’ music. 

Listen closely to songs like Tupac’s “Hail Mary” Or “Ambitionz Az A Ridah,” aside from the menacing delivery and the vulgarity, he’s reciting his lyrics like they’re a Mother Goose tale. 

My daughter and I listen to some select Tupac songs, and have discussed his impact– as well as the legacies of Amy Winehouse, Bob Marley, Aaliyah and other artists who’ve become ancestors too soon.

Pendarvis Harshaw: Through them we’ve discussed oppression and liberation, Pac’s connection to Oakland and the Black Panther Party. And we’ve talked about the real meanings of the B-word and the N-word.

Pendarvis Harshaw:  I’m mindful of the cuss words, as well as the sentiment in the songs I play when she’s around. I try to stay away from the R&B songs that have lyrics like “I can’t live without you,” because language about healthy relationships is just as important as learning not to cuss.

And we haven’t even gotten to the rap songs with violent lyrics, references to drugs or deep-seated misogyny. 

But she knows who Tupac, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube are. And at the age of seven, she can identify the voices of Erykah Badu and Stevie Wonder. 

The educational exploration of music hasn’t stopped her from learning “Baby Shark” or memorizing songs from The Little Mermaid soundtrack, she’s still very much so a kid. 

And I’m enjoying seeing her grow. I’m fortunate to have this experience. Some people don’t have the luxury of playing music constantly, or riding around discussing art with their children. Some folks aren’t even able to be with their children at all. So I don’t take this time for granted. 

Pendarvis Harshaw:  Four years ago at the funeral for the late hip-hop legend and entrepreneur, Nipsey Hussle, his longtime girlfriend, the talented actress Lauren London, said something that I think about a lot.  

She stood behind a podium, wearing a bright white gown and dark black sunglasses, as her hair draped over her shoulders.

Speaking to the audience at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, she shared a prepared statement reflecting on what Nipsey brought to the world– and specifically their family. 

Pendarvis Harshaw: She said that Nipsey would wake up in the morning and play music for the kids, simultaneously lighting sage and burning it around the house. It was his effort to get everyone’s energy right before walking out the door. 

I think about that – as I’m lighting an incense or a candle as the sun rises, and i’m looking through my playlists trying to figure out the first song of the day. Knowing that I’m not just a dad posing as a DJ, but a human using one of the highest forms of art to lend some guidance to another human who is on their spiritual journey.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

PS5 Laku Keras Gara-gara Game ini?,detikInet,4 bulan lalu,https://inet.detik.com/games-news/d-6856005/ps5-laku-keras-gara-gara-game-ini,"Belum lama ini Sony blak-blakan soal penjualan PS5 yang cukup fantastis. Meski jumlahnya masih belum bisa menyaingi sedulurnya, yakni PS2, akan tetapi sudah cukup untuk menumbangkan kompetitornya, Xbox.

Tercatat sejak diluncurkan pada bulan November 2020 hingga saat ini, PS5 sudah terjual sebanyak 40 juta unit. Angka tersebut tercapai pada tanggal 16 Juli 2023 lalu.

Lantas apa faktor yang menunjang Sony untuk bisa mencapai tonggak sejarah itu? Jim Ryan, Presiden & CEO Sony Interactive Entertainment, menyampaikan bahwa kesulitan mereka menjual next-gen ini karena kekurangan stok.

""Kami terus menghadapi hambatan dengan pandemi, dan butuh waktu berbulan-bulan untuk rantai pasokan menjadi normal sehingga kami dapat memiliki inventaris untuk memenuhi permintaan,"" ujar Ryan, dikutip detikINET dari situs resminya.

Namun sekarang ketersediaan PS5 sudah cukup lengkap. Jadi Sony bisa memenuhi kebutuhan gamer, supaya bisa mendapatkan dan memainkan konsol terbaru mereka.

""Sekarang pasokan PS5 cukup lengkap dan kami melihat bahwa permintaan yang terpendam akhirnya terpenuhi. Dengan dukungan para penggemar PlayStation, kami telah mencapai tonggak sejarah berupa penjualan 40 juta konsol PS5,"" kata Ryan.

Selain faktor tersebut, sepertinya kehadiran game baru juga turut menjadi elemen penting yang menarik gamer untuk membeli PS5. Sejak dirilis, PS5 sudah memiliki lebih dari 2.500 game ciamik.

Menurut Ryan, beberapa di antaranya yang sudah bermitra dengan mereka seperti Final Fantasy XVI, Diablo IV, dan Street Fighter 6. Namun tidak hanya itu saja, dia turut mengungkapkan 40 game PS5 yang menjadi favorit gamer berdasarkan penilaian komunitas.

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

“True Detective: Night Country” Official Trailer – Jodie Foster Hunts a Killer in the Arctic This January

‘Devils’ – Acclaimed Body-Swap Thriller in the Vein of ‘Face/Off’ Heading to SCREAMBOX Tomorrow! [Trailer]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

Born Brazilian, raised Canadian, Luiz is a writer and Film student that spends most of his time watching movies and subsequently complaining about them.

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi. Pengumuman ini disampaikan langsung oleh sang kreator, Dan Salvato melalui akun twitter resminya.

I'm delighted to announce Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, a labor of love from @TeamSalvato and @SerenityForge. #DDLCPlus includes new features and content and releases June 30th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox. https://t.co/iRWD66q98EInfo in thread! pic.twitter.com/4I2hnDA2j7

Dan Salvato menjelaskan bahwa DDLC+ akan membawa berbagai konten baru meliputi side stories, yakni cerita sampingan yang menjelaskan bagaimana persahabatan dari para heroine di klub literatur terbentuk. Side stories sendiri akan terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan. Artwork dari side stories sendiri dikerjakan oleh ilustrator LucidSky dan SquChan, serta VelinquenT sebagai ilustrator latar belakang.

Selanjutnya adalah in-built music player yang terdiri dari 26 trek lagu, meliputi 13 lagu orisinal, side stories, serta guest tracks dari Jason Hayes, sang komposer dari game World of Warcraft.

Lalu yang terakhir adalah art gallery, yang meliputi lebih dari 100 artwork dan wallpaper dalam game termasuk sketsa konsep yang belum pernah dirilis sebelumnya oleh Team Salvato.

DDLC+ akan dirilis pada tanggal 30 Juni mendatang untuk platform PlayStation, Xbox, PC, dan Nintendo Switch. DDLC+ sendiri tersedia dalam dua varian, yakni versi digital dan versi fisik yang lengkap dengan berbagai merchandise dari franchise DDLC, tersedia untuk PlayStation dan Switch.

Versi digital sendiri akan dibanderol seharga $15 (213 ribu Rupiah) dan versi fisik edisi spesial seharga $30 (426 ribu Rupiah). Untuk pre-ordernya sendiri dapat dilakukan di Serenity Forge Store melalui link disini.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka. Game ini punya tema berat mengenai kesehatan mental di samping mempertontonkan para ""waifu"" yang kita pilih.

Para penggemar juga bisa berharap lebih jika Dan Salvato memutuskan untuk menghadirkan spin-off. Bisa jadi, ada gameplay baru yang bakal diusung sama sang pembuat game dewasa ini. Apakah kalian bisa membayangkan jika Doki Doki Literature Club memakai gaya role playing game atau RPG dengan pilihan para waifu sebagai karakter permainan?

Buat kalian yang menunggu, tampaknya berita kedatangan episode atau game baru Doki Doki Literature Club masih cukup lama. Pasalnya, Dan Salvato baru merencanakan pengembangan saja. Tentunya butuh waktu pengembangan yang cukup lama jika dirinya ingin menelurkan game baru.

Apakah kalian juga sempat memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club? Jangan sungkan untuk bagikan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar bawah, ya! Terus ikutin juga berita game dan tulisan menarik lainnya hanya di KINCIR.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

“True Detective: Night Country” Official Trailer – Jodie Foster Hunts a Killer in the Arctic This January

‘Devils’ – Acclaimed Body-Swap Thriller in the Vein of ‘Face/Off’ Heading to SCREAMBOX Tomorrow! [Trailer]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

Born Brazilian, raised Canadian, Luiz is a writer and Film student that spends most of his time watching movies and subsequently complaining about them.

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka. Game ini punya tema berat mengenai kesehatan mental di samping mempertontonkan para ""waifu"" yang kita pilih.

Para penggemar juga bisa berharap lebih jika Dan Salvato memutuskan untuk menghadirkan spin-off. Bisa jadi, ada gameplay baru yang bakal diusung sama sang pembuat game dewasa ini. Apakah kalian bisa membayangkan jika Doki Doki Literature Club memakai gaya role playing game atau RPG dengan pilihan para waifu sebagai karakter permainan?

Buat kalian yang menunggu, tampaknya berita kedatangan episode atau game baru Doki Doki Literature Club masih cukup lama. Pasalnya, Dan Salvato baru merencanakan pengembangan saja. Tentunya butuh waktu pengembangan yang cukup lama jika dirinya ingin menelurkan game baru.

Apakah kalian juga sempat memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club? Jangan sungkan untuk bagikan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar bawah, ya! Terus ikutin juga berita game dan tulisan menarik lainnya hanya di KINCIR.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

Through word-of-mouth and widespread streaming of playthroughs by fans, the game garnered a huge community and amassed over 13.5 million downloads worldwide.

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

“True Detective: Night Country” Official Trailer – Jodie Foster Hunts a Killer in the Arctic This January

‘Devils’ – Acclaimed Body-Swap Thriller in the Vein of ‘Face/Off’ Heading to SCREAMBOX Tomorrow! [Trailer]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi. Pengumuman ini disampaikan langsung oleh sang kreator, Dan Salvato melalui akun twitter resminya.

I'm delighted to announce Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, a labor of love from @TeamSalvato and @SerenityForge. #DDLCPlus includes new features and content and releases June 30th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox. https://t.co/iRWD66q98EInfo in thread! pic.twitter.com/4I2hnDA2j7

Dan Salvato menjelaskan bahwa DDLC+ akan membawa berbagai konten baru meliputi side stories, yakni cerita sampingan yang menjelaskan bagaimana persahabatan dari para heroine di klub literatur terbentuk. Side stories sendiri akan terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan. Artwork dari side stories sendiri dikerjakan oleh ilustrator LucidSky dan SquChan, serta VelinquenT sebagai ilustrator latar belakang.

Selanjutnya adalah in-built music player yang terdiri dari 26 trek lagu, meliputi 13 lagu orisinal, side stories, serta guest tracks dari Jason Hayes, sang komposer dari game World of Warcraft.

Lalu yang terakhir adalah art gallery, yang meliputi lebih dari 100 artwork dan wallpaper dalam game termasuk sketsa konsep yang belum pernah dirilis sebelumnya oleh Team Salvato.

DDLC+ akan dirilis pada tanggal 30 Juni mendatang untuk platform PlayStation, Xbox, PC, dan Nintendo Switch. DDLC+ sendiri tersedia dalam dua varian, yakni versi digital dan versi fisik yang lengkap dengan berbagai merchandise dari franchise DDLC, tersedia untuk PlayStation dan Switch.

Versi digital sendiri akan dibanderol seharga $15 (213 ribu Rupiah) dan versi fisik edisi spesial seharga $30 (426 ribu Rupiah). Untuk pre-ordernya sendiri dapat dilakukan di Serenity Forge Store melalui link disini.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka. Game ini punya tema berat mengenai kesehatan mental di samping mempertontonkan para ""waifu"" yang kita pilih.

Para penggemar juga bisa berharap lebih jika Dan Salvato memutuskan untuk menghadirkan spin-off. Bisa jadi, ada gameplay baru yang bakal diusung sama sang pembuat game dewasa ini. Apakah kalian bisa membayangkan jika Doki Doki Literature Club memakai gaya role playing game atau RPG dengan pilihan para waifu sebagai karakter permainan?

Buat kalian yang menunggu, tampaknya berita kedatangan episode atau game baru Doki Doki Literature Club masih cukup lama. Pasalnya, Dan Salvato baru merencanakan pengembangan saja. Tentunya butuh waktu pengembangan yang cukup lama jika dirinya ingin menelurkan game baru.

Apakah kalian juga sempat memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club? Jangan sungkan untuk bagikan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar bawah, ya! Terus ikutin juga berita game dan tulisan menarik lainnya hanya di KINCIR.

The Best Anime Games To Play In 2023 and Beyond - The SportsRush,TheSportsRush,3 hari lalu,https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-best-anime-games-play-2023-beyond/,"The world got hooked on anime quite recently. The craze for most fans started with Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments. Nowadays we have blockbuster titles like Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and more. Naturally, game developers wasted no time tapping into this market, and we have several well-known anime games today. Likewise, this article will look at the best anime games you can find online that are worth playing.

These games encapsulate all the genres you can think of ranging from open-world to fighting games and action-adventure titles. We won’t stay exclusive to console titles and also look at the ones available on PC. Let us get started.

A couple of entries on this list are not based on traditional anime but have an anime-like art style which is why they fit perfectly. These are games that span across a variety of genres such as visual novel titles, action, fighting, and adventure so you will have plenty of options and can pick and choose according to what you like.

If console and PC don’t appeal to you, there are many titles like Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact which are perfect games for mobile players.

Starting the list off with Persona 5 Royal, we have a game that is not necessarily an anime game but has the art style of one. In addition, it is one of the best game franchises of all time which offers endless hours of fun and curious characters.

Persona 5 Royal is a role-playing game where you take on the character of Joker, a silent protagonist who is new in town and has a shady past. Soon you learn that the people of the town aren’t what they seem and they have bad ulterior motives. You get transported to a place called the metaverse along with a friend and soon find out you have the powers of a Wildcard; the ability to manifest multiple Personas.

The most famous aspect of the Persona games returns with the Social Link aspect where you will have to befriend people and take your friendship to the next level to gain gameplay buffs in the metaverse. Most of the people you befriend then go on to become part of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group that navigates the metaverse and changes the hearts of corrupt people.

Essentially, the game is a hybrid between a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, and social simulation game which is tons of fun and offers something for everyone. We highly recommend that you check this game out before any other one on this list.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the best anime franchises of all time, not only that, but they have some really good games as well. DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 is on the hotlist of every DBZ fan and for good reason. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 comes quite close to the level of 3D detailing that Budokai Tenkaichi had but it doesn’t cut it. However, that does not mean this game is inherently bad.

Xenoverse 2 is an experience, to say the least. It is an action role-playing game where you take on the role of a silent protagonist who is able to navigate important events throughout the timeline of DBZ with the help of Future Trunks and the Time Patrol. You can customize the character that you play and give them abilities that are prominent in the franchise ranging from the Solar Flare to the Kamehame Ha.

In addition, once you surpass certain quests you can see various characters from the DBZ franchise hang around Conton City ranging from Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan to Goku and Vegeta. By all means, this game is an out-of-the-box journey that puts you alongside the Z Warriors in their quest and gives you a chance to retell the story of the DBZ franchise.

It might not be the cup of tea for most players who want a hands-on experience of playing the characters for the battle they partake in, like Tenkaichi 3 but it certainly works when it comes to the 3D-based environment.

Honkai Star Rail is another entry on this list which might not necessarily be an anime game but does the job of looking the part through its art style. It took the world by storm when it was released in 2023 and is still a great-looking game due to the level of detail, story, and world-building set out by the developers at HoYo.

The game is a role-playing gacha video game that features multiple characters you can play as in a turn-based battle. The characters have unique abilities and weapons that inflict damage and apply passive nerfs to the enemies. Essentially, players have to control a team comprising four characters and lead them through missions solving problems, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

There are multiple story missions you can partake in and also side missions you can accomplish from various sources and places you visit. Honkai Star Rail has an exclusive list of quirky characters who have become fan favorites ranging from March 7th to Kafka and Dan Heng. Due to its anime-like art style, it has become a fan favorite among players.

Honkai Star Rail is almost like Genshin Impact. Both games share tons of similarities. Therefore, if you like playing Genshin, then you will enjoy Honkai Star Rail. It has tons of cool characters, huge open worlds, a fun combat and upgrade system, and tons of lore that will have you wanting more.

Who does not like Naruto? One of the greatest stories ever told turns into a fighting game where you can play as Naruto and other ninjas from the franchise. This is one of the best anime games and it has lots of elements that are worthy of praise including the fluent combat system which integrates techniques and moves flawlessly from the anime.

Although you can always play Ninja Storm 4, this one is a little better even though it was released a few years later and has visual upgrades. The game also has a mob battle mode where characters find mobs. The controls are changed for the mob mode. In addition, players can choose from 80 different playable characters which makes it even better.

The franchise has been in the eyes of the public for years. Therefore, making a game that can please the fans is a task in itself. The developers delivered and made a game that is evergreen and worth investing in for hours on end. Due to its simple premise and loyalty to the source material, the game received lots of praise from fans and critics alike.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the Ultimate Naruto experience filled with bits and pieces from the original storyline, then this is one of the best anime games for you. It has everything you would want from the franchise including emotions, high-end gameplay, and fast-paced action. You should give this a try if you like the DBZ Budokai fighting games.

My Hero Academia has quickly become a fan-favorite shonen anime due to its complex characters, emotional moments, plot twists, and various storylines involving larger-than-life villains. Taking advantage of the fan flare-up due to the anime, Bandai Namco set out on a mission to make a My Hero Academia game worthy of the success of the anime.

The first game and the second game lived up to the mark and gave the fans exactly what they wanted. A big roster consisting of their favorite characters, both heroes and villains. The game does a good job of simplifying the combat system so that it does not hamper the speed of the gameplay. The game expands on the characters of My Hero Academia’s abilities quite well and gives players a lot of freedom to use them up to their liking in a 3d environment.

One’s Justice also has fun environments you can play in which make the fights even more entertaining to watch. You will never get tired of playing as your favorite characters ranging from All Might and Deku to Bakugo and Tenya. You can also customize the costumes of the characters you have which is the icing on the cake.

New strategic changes like the Stamina system and the dodges make the game more strategic for those looking for an integration of other fighting games. All in all, this game is a title that My Hero Academia fans must try just for its beautiful graphics and gameplay. The sheer amount of character options is also a good incentive.

A lot of Sword Art Online players loved this game due to the combat system. However, the best part about this anime game is how flawlessly it blended visual novel, dungeon crawling and action-adventure game styles into one. The Sword Art Online franchise is most famous for its protagonist Kirito, who is ironically a womanizer. That fact is reflected in this game at times but it does not overpower the plot.

Players have argued that the progression of this game is far better than the plot of the anime. That you will have to figure out for yourself. However, we guarantee you one thing, you will have a lot of fun with the customizable abilities and everything that you can do to improve your character’s flexibility in battles.

The gameplay has tons of MMORPG elements which players of the genre will enjoy in addition to 100 characters that you can recruit on your journey. Essentially, you are playing a dungeon crawler, action-adventure, visual novel, and an MMORPG in one. There is also a limited multiplayer but don’t expect players to be playing it right now.

However, the biggest appeal of this game is that it can provide a true Sword Art Online experience that fans craved ever since they have watched the anime. Even though the reviewer scores do not show it, it is an experience worth trying out.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 retells the story of the Wano Arc in a satisfying way. The combat system of this game is on par with the previous games in this series but it improves upon it a little. The combos are satisfying, the graphics are adequate and the storytelling takes the cake.

One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is amazingly funny and does the job of telling a good story with a little bit of everything in it. Essentially, the game summarizes 900 episodes worth of material in a few hours of the campaign and does the job well. There are more than 50 different characters to play from, each of them having a move-set that is fun to play and combo hundreds of mobs with.

The boss fights are short but satisfying and the story has lots of replayability value. The original cast return to voice the characters and the game’s engine recreates the moments from the show brilliantly. The game offers you the option to select one hero that is important to the story of each mission and then accompanying characters of your choosing.

The game’s length feels very short if you are one of those people who want to try out every character. However, that is the biggest appeal of this game. One Piece fans will have a grand old time deciphering and repeating mob-destroying combos of their favorite characters. Not to mention, the score is brilliant which keeps the epicness scale ticking.

This is the Attack on Titan every fan of the anime should experience at least once in their lives. It is one of the best anime games to play and can easily be considered one of the best anime games. Due to its hack-and-slash nature, we have fast-paced action coupled with amazing voice acting. The game has tons of good things going for it including its graphics, an assortment of fan-favorite characters, and a large open world.

The main campaign allows you to play through the story of Attack on Titan. There are tons of things you can do in this game that will keep you occupied for hours ranging from equipment upgrades and weapon creation to exploration. There are also side quests you can take part in to unlock more accessible things.

This game also has a sequel that is worth checking out after you finish it. This game is no dark horse as it outsold Street Fighter V when it was released in Japan. There are epilogue chapters as well that you can check out should you complete the campaign missions. Attack on Titan Wings of Freedom is the kind of game that is an unexpected wonder.

It is one of the best anime games in recent times and the sequel is as good as the first one should you want to play it.

Visual Novels are the lifeblood of anime games and no one does it better than the original visual novel games. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy combines three of the major visual novels; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations. Essentially, you are getting three different games in one and the story of one of the greatest anime characters of all time.

You will be busy solving cases by detecting and deciphering clues and also trialing in the courtroom. You can cross-examine witnesses, prove your client’s innocence, and combine evidence to solve cases. When a case is solved you unlock a new one and so on. The first game has five different cases you can solve. The second game, Justice for All has four cases while the third game, Trials and Tribulations has five.

The trilogy is one of the most thrilling and engaging visual novel experiences of all time as deciphering clues and attending court becomes the hardest thing you have to do. The reason why this game trilogy is so high up on this list is that it is not the usual action-adventure title. It will keep you on your toes and entertained throughout the trilogy.

The Phoenix Wright Trilogy is not for everyone but for fans of the franchise it is a nice gift of what made their childhood awesome. We definitely recommend playing this if you are a fan of visual novels.

This is the anime game most gamers start with if they are a fan of anime. On paper, this looks like a harem anime visual novel but soon turns into something that you wouldn’t expect in any wholesome and tacky harem anime. You control a protagonist who joins the high school’s literature club and is given the option to pursue three out of the four girls present in the club.

Initially, you will that this game is a dating simulator but after a point in time, it turns into a psychological horror game with fourth wall breaks and more. This game has the darkest moments any anime game that is expected to be a wholesome dating sim could have. With dark themes such as suicide, depression, and metafictional storytelling, Doki Doki Literature Club is not for the lighthearted.

Having said that, it is an exploration into the psyche of humans, no matter how extreme it gets at times. That is why, we recommend that you proceed with caution as it is going to get uncomfortable at times. That being said, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience so we definitely recommend that you play this game at least once.

Is Doki Doki Literature Club a horror game?,Destructoid,2 bulan lalu,https://www.destructoid.com/is-doki-doki-literature-club-a-horror-game/,"Have you ever been in this situation? You’re stuck at home on a Friday night with nothing to do, so you decide to check Steam to see if anything catches your eye. Then, as if by divine providence, you come across a bright and colorful visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club.

It looks like your typical anime-based visual novel game. But you might recall someone telling you that you should go into this one blind, because this seemingly innocuous dating sim is hiding its true nature just beneath the surface. Well, it has an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam — and it’s free, so you decide there’s nothing wrong with giving Doki Doki Literature Club a shot.

But then you see it has the “psychological horror” tag on Steam. So you start to wonder — what’s up with Doki Doki Literature Club? Is it a horror game disguised as an innocent dating sim? Or is it just a big joke that it’s tagged as “psychological horror”?

Yes. I recall my first experience with Doki Doki Literature Club, shortly after it first launched. I was mostly checking it out because I had heard — as stated above — that it was one game where you didn’t want to judge a metaphorical book by its metaphorical cover. So, I decided to stream it in practically one session.

And, for probably about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, it was a perfectly normal, sugar-coated VN. It follows an unnamed, unseen character who is practically forced to join their school’s literature club by a childhood friend, Sayori. From there, they meet three other girls — Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. In what I will call the prologue to Doki Doki Literature Club, you will bond with your club-mates, write seemingly nonsensical poems, and eat cupcakes. But then… things take a very, very, very dark turn.

I won’t dive into that here. It’s definitely worth seeing it for yourself, but if you are sensitive to themes of depression, suicidal ideation, or self-harm, you should be aware that Doki Doki Literature Club has these in spades. I am not saying you shouldn’t play it, because it is a story worth reading, but know your limits. 

Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game, despite its colorful anime aesthetic and cheerful theme song. It’ll also lodge its way into your brain so that you’re thinking about it for days after the credits roll.

Doki Doki Literature Club and What We Can Learn from a Killer AI ...,The Escapist,9 bulan lalu,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/doki-doki-literature-club-ddlc-what-we-can-learn-from-killer-ai-valentine/,"What do you think of first when you hear the term dating sim? Do you get a sweet feeling of soft fond memories of gaining heart events with your Stardew Valley spouse? Maybe it reminds you of competing for a werewolf’s affection against friends in Monster Prom? Am I the only one who recalls slamming the off button on the laptop as a young teenager when I heard a parent walking down to the computer room after I had first decided to explore a smutty Newgrounds game thinking the family had gone to bed?

However sweet, fun, or spicy your experience with dating sims has been, gamers have been connecting to virtual girls and boys since at least 1992. It’s fun to give an NPC their favorite gift to build relationship points or pick that conversation answer that gets a heart emoji from your in-game crush. What can be better than dating in a controlled environment where you can reset the game, change your answers, and re-raise that support level?

But whenever I’m feeling too cozy with an in-game crush, I can’t help shaking the fears that the 2017 indie classic Doki Doki Literature Club instilled in me. The game is a psychological thriller disguised as a cozy Japanese schoolyard dating sim in which the player joins an after-school poetry club that features four of the genre’s classic stereotypes. Sayori is the sweet and slightly awkward girl next door, Yuri is the dark academia witchy weird girl, Natsuki is the slightly bratty spunky small one, and then Monika is the popular put-together club president.

For those who have played DDLC, the game’s horror elements start to arise amid cute rhyming minigames and picking which bachelorettes to hang out with. Monika, who it turns out is much more than her kawaii anime drawing sprite suggests, reveals herself to be sentient. She starts manipulating the game to her advantage, drawing the player away from the other three girls. And as these efforts fail, she begins to off her competition by reprogramming the other characters’ quirks into a nauseating slurry of suicidal tendencies and deep psychosis.

Monika’s takeover extends beyond digitally murdering her fellow club members, as she eventually begins corrupting the game itself, accessing your desktop files and eventually taking over your computer. The player’s only escape comes after she accidentally lets slip how to delete her by deleting a file subheader outside the game. For those wondering what happened to the dating-sim aspects, don’t worry: She spills this information during a sinister dinner date at a hellish fiery kitchen table.

DDLC is filled with jump scares, heartbreak, psychological horror, and some other truly fucked-up stuff, but the game’s biggest strength is how it makes you care about its cast just genuinely enough. As zany as the premise of “AI takes over a dating sim to get that ring” is, the game holds no punches in showing you each character’s fears and inner demons.

Each bachelorette is in need of something more than you as the player can provide for them. Even as non-sentient characters, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki all become fully realized, unlike the stereotypical cardboard cutouts most dating games present, each hinting at mental health issues that you can only respond to with flirtatious or dismissive follow-ups.

Even if they are momentarily relieved by your character’s haphazard conversation options, it becomes more and more clear that the girls are not the traditional dating-sim fodder that simply exist to serve the base emotional needs of the player. They all know something is off about themselves and their situations, and those base conversational options you’re tossing at them to get them to agree to go on a date with you are not going to save them no matter which angle you try.

Monika’s obsession with the player works to present a dating sim fan with a dose of their own medicine. Monika is aware of her in-game abilities, able to manipulate game mechanics and decision trees to maximize their potential to woo their target, just like the player. She’s some classic AI horror, sure. But because she’s capable of the same level of heinous obsession and manipulation as the player, she brings some terrifying insights to human horror as well.

I’ve made it a habit to watch my friend play DDLC every Valentine’s Day as a cathartic reminder of how love is supposed to work. It certainly isn’t cute or cuddly, and I’ll note it should be avoided by those with triggers surrounding mental illness. But it presents an actual look at how we view our own relationships and crushes. It gives considerable insight in how to grow outside of your goals with another person. And it will leave you reevaluating if any of those dating-sim tactics you use when wooing an NPC are creeping into how you’re trying to hold your real-life relationships.

For players who revisit the game after Monika has been defeated and are looking to enjoy a dating sim free from corruption, they will discover that now the sweet and caring Sayori is becoming as sentient and even more dangerous than Monika. Before the game even gets very far, Monika returns from the cloud and deletes DDLC. She sacrifices herself and her world not for her own manipulative reasons, but surprisingly as a selfless effort to protect the player. She’s had time to think in the cloud and realizes the healthiest way to show her love is by rescuing them. As the game ends and the credits cue, Monika performs a cute bubbly acoustic song, “Your Reality,” as her farewell to the player.

When I first got to this final farewell, I found myself thinking back on things I said over the game. I’d picked conversations with Sayori to win her over rather than things that would have encouraged a more therapeutic angle. I ignored some telling moments concerning Yuri’s occasional obsession with violence just to get her into a cute library date. I’d ignored Natsuki in several moments that could have kept her safe.

What were the right answers? Should I have chosen Monika to save everyone from their fates? What were the steps I should’ve done in-game to support these characters I’d grown to care about?

En 2024 estará online la novela visual uruguaya Jake’s Paralysis,La Diaria,12 jam lalu,https://ladiaria.com.uy/cultura/articulo/2023/12/en-2024-estara-online-la-novela-visual-uruguaya-jakes-paralysis/,"Las novelas visuales son un género de videojuegos que se caracterizan por enfocarse tanto en la narrativa como en la toma de decisiones. A diferencia de los juegos convencionales, las visual novels tienden a manejar una jugabilidad más centrada en la historia: múltiples rutas, finales basados en las decisiones. Con personajes dibujados, fondos detallados y una presencia estética atractiva, son furor en Japón. Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa con estos juegos en este lado del mundo? ¿Interesan? ¿Hay un mercado? ¿Existe algún proyecto doméstico?

La respuesta veloz es “sí” y, ahora mismo, estamos ante un videojuego rarísimo, curioso y hasta indómito. Uno de esos proyectos que no se encuadran dentro de las movidas hot del universo gamer actual (y occidental): no es un multijugador de arena de batalla en línea a lo League of Legends, ni es un first person shooter como Valorant, ni es –tampoco– un deportivo tipo FC 2024 (así se llama el nuevo FIFA). De hecho, sus coordenadas se digitan a contrapelo: Jake’s Paralysis: tiene el extraño mérito de formar parte de la primera camada de visual novels con estética anime/manga asiática del Río de la Plata. 

El videojuego creado por el desarrollador uruguayo Bruno Ferrari (conocido profesionalmente como Brunomir) se presenta como una mezcla entre un simulador de citas y un slice of life que, poco a poco, va tornándose más y más oscuro. Las referencias más evidentes apuntan a Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, un clásico de la animación japonesa, y las cabezas de millennials y centennials estallan de emoción.

Por caso, Jake’s Paralysis junto a Attack Helicopter Dating Simulator y My Dream Sport Dating Simulator configuran el tridente inaugural de un género que explota en tierras niponas (un 70% del mercado del gaming para PC) pero que, en Uruguay, está dando sus primeros pasos. 

“Sigue la búsqueda de Jake para conquistar el corazón de su chica ideal, pero ten cuidado: cada intento por besarlas lo catapultará entre estos dos fascinantes mundos, ofreciendo múltiples finales impactantes por descubrir”, avisa la sinopsis de este thriller. Como un Elige tu propia aventura pero para la compu y bastante más chicloso y retorcido.

Con un lanzamiento previsto para finales de 2024, Jake’s Paralysis, cuyo avance fue presentado en sociedad delante de 25.000 personas en la Exposición de Videojuegos Argentinos (EVA) en Buenos Aires, estará disponible para PC y Nintendo Switch. “A lo largo de mi vida, las novelas visuales han dejado una marca profunda en mi creatividad”, confiesa Ferrari. 

Entre sus inspiraciones, reconoce a Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy) y Doki Doki Literature Club!, dos proyectos que comprimen una narrativa interactiva convencional con múltiples opciones y eventos rápidos. “El mercado occidental está receptivo a novelas visuales con esta estética”, aventura. Sin embargo, son pocos los proyectos locales que se paran sobre ese umbral narrativo.

Además de su trabajo en Jake’s Paralysis, Brunomir tiene experiencia en el cosmos de la gamificación y en la creación de juegos desde cero. Un ejemplo reciente es el Water 2050, un juego educativo de gestión urbana que se consigue vía Steam y plataformas móviles. Asimismo, este desarrollador independiente lleva tiempo trabajando en la industria del videojuego y se ha desempeñado en la creación de simuladores en realidad virtual para el manejo de maquinaria pesada. En la actualidad, trabaja desarrollando softwares de realidad aumentada enfocados en el ámbito de la salud.

“Team Brunomir es un estudio extremadamente pequeño que se autofinancia. Dado que aún no hemos lanzado nuestro juego, no estamos generando ingresos. Y por eso intentamos ofrecer servicios. Creemos firmemente en la calidad de nuestro producto y estamos seguros de que, si llegamos al público adecuado, les encantará”, explica Ferrari sobre este proyecto que cuenta en sus filas con profesionales de Indonesia, Pakistán y Cuba, entre otras latitudes.

“El desarrollo de juegos no es sólo un trabajo, es una oportunidad para expresarte en diversos aspectos artísticos, narrativos, de jugabilidad y muchos más. Especialmente cuando estás construyendo tus propios juegos. La libertad creativa es incomparable”, cuenta el profesional de 39 años nacido y criado en Juan Lacaze.

No obstante, es muy probable que por la singularidad del tópico y por tratarse de un mercado naciente, el Jake’s Paralysis vaya encontrando su público a partir de su viralidad en Internet. “Estamos emocionados por lo que viene y por llevar nuestro juego a nuevos horizontes”, dice el developer. A la sazón, ya cuenta con un primer capítulo disponible para jugar de forma gratuita y quienes lo han probado destacan su enorme calidad gráfica y lo definido de sus animaciones y fondos. 

“Consideramos que vamos por buen camino y con seguridad, afirmamos que este primer capítulo representa aproximadamente un 85% de la visión que tenemos para Jake's Paralysis. El restante 15% se centra principalmente en la expansión del contenido gráfico y la incorporación de múltiples senderos por descubrir”, cierra Brunomir mientras abre la puerta de sus ficciones semi interactivas.

6 Meta Horror Video Games to Play After You Finish 'Alan Wake 2',Bloody Disgusting!,6 hari lalu,https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3790148/6-meta-horror-video-games-to-play-after-you-finish-alan-wake-2/,"‘Destroy All Neighbors’ – Shudder’s Splatter-Comedy Starring Alex Winter Gets Rockin’ New Poster [Exclusive]

“True Detective: Night Country” Official Trailer – Jodie Foster Hunts a Killer in the Arctic This January

‘Devils’ – Acclaimed Body-Swap Thriller in the Vein of ‘Face/Off’ Heading to SCREAMBOX Tomorrow! [Trailer]

From The Cabin in the Woods to House of Leaves, meta-horror can be one of the most entertaining sub-genres for die-hard fans when made by passionate creators. However, I think videogames are the medium with the most potential when it comes to immersing us in meta-narratives. I mean, the very concept of someone controlling a character’s actions through an interactive experience already adds an additional layer to the story, so it makes sense that developers might try and use this fragile fourth wall to scare players.

In 2023, we saw an excellent example of this in Remedy Entertainment’s Alan Wake 2, a long-awaited love-letter to survival-horror that relishes in simulating both gaming and storytelling tropes. And if you loved the game as much as I did, you might find yourself craving for even more meta scares – which is why we’ve come up with this list recommending 6 of the creepiest meta-horror games in recent memory.

As usual, this list is purely based on personal opinion, but don’t forget to comment below with your own meta favorites if you think we missed a particularly mind-bending one. After all, there’s nothing quite like questioning your own reality after playing a good horror title.

A visual novel might not seem like a serious contender for a chilling horror experience, and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Team Salvato’s Doki Doki Literature Club! is a simple dating simulator, but it doesn’t take long for players to realize that there’s something truly wrong going on behind the scenes here.

While gameplay is initially divided between open-ended conversations with the cutesy members of the titular literature club and a randomized poem creator, players are soon confronted with eerie ruminations on mortality and mental illness, as well as a series of intentional glitches. I won’t spoil what happens next, but suffice to say that this one plays out like an interactive creepypasta.

A short but sweet reflection on the very concept of gaming, Blooming Bud Studio’s Calendula is likely the most meta title on this list. Challenging players with attempting to play a seemingly sentient game that refuses to be played, there’s much more to this horror-puzzle hybrid than meets the eye – especially once you get to the first-person snippets of storytelling.

For starters, the interface itself function as an antagonist, with the player being forced to work around buggy menus and obtuse clues in order to find out what lies at the heart of Calendula. The experience may not be for everyone, and I think the short length means that this title is best purchased during a sale, but I guarantee that you won’t forget these puzzles anytime soon.

Developed by Ivan Zanotti, this so-called “Pixelated Nightmare” was a viral hit back when it was first released, impressing legions of screaming YouTubers as well as gaming journalists who praised the title’s minimalist scares. The praise was well deserved, as IMSCARED manages to turn your own computer against you in order to tell an ambiguous yarn about a haunted game.

From fake blue-screens-of-death to installing mysterious files onto your hard-drive, there’s a reason why this title is often considered a gamified form of malware. And while other games have also tried their hand at some of these tricks over the years, you just can’t beat the original.

Like all the best meta-fiction, Daniel Mullins’ Pony Island contains several layers of co-existing narrative. Here, players take control of an unnamed gamer who encounters the titular arcade cabinet and discovers that it has been corrupted by the devil himself. Fortunately, the soul of a previously trapped player attempts to help you hack the game and save yourself from Satan’s digitized grasp.

Clearly inspired by urban legends like the infamous Polybius, Pony Island switches between arcade gameplay and the cabinet’s corrupted programming as you embark on a reality-shifting experience. Personally, I think the creepiest part is the inclusion of fake error screens and steam messages meant to convince you that the game is corrupting your real-world computer.

Another Daniel Mullins game, Inscryption ticked quite a few boxes for me personally. A rogue-like deck-building game with a spooky aesthetic and live-action found footage elements? Sign me the hell up! And while the title is extremely engaging as a randomized card game (so much so that the developers went on to include an endless mode that ignored the story), it’s the meta-fictional angle that really makes it stand out.

From your cards literally begging you not to be sacrificed to being forced to delete personal files in your computer or videogame console in order to gain a bonus (the older and more sentimental the better), Inscryption will get under your skin even if you’re not a fan of digital card games.

Full of trippy imagery and plenty of ruminations on the fickle nature of simulacra and simulation (especially when you consider that the entire game is about shapeshifting entities disguising themselves as inanimate objects), it makes sense that Arkane’s incredibly underrated Prey makes it onto this list. However, if you’ve never played the game before, I’d advise against reading the next spoiler-filled paragraph…

The real reason I think Prey is a great example of meta-horror storytelling is its shocking twist ending, as the finale reveals that you’ve been diagetically playing a horrific simulation the entire time, with the player character actually being one of the shapeshifting aliens who only thinks that it’s really the protagonist. If that doesn’t just scream meta-horror, I don’t know what does!

Born Brazilian, raised Canadian, Luiz is a writer and Film student that spends most of his time watching movies and subsequently complaining about them.

It’s been nearly 70 years since Godzilla first step foot on the silver screen with Ishiro Honda’s 1954 opus, Gojira. What started as an allegory about the horrors of the atomic bomb and war has since been reimagined myriad times to cover everything from the awesome forces of nature to geopolitical alliances, the absurdities of consumerism to mankind’s inability to curb pollution. Whether Godzilla is a tragic monster, a defender of earth, or children’s role model, there’s no denying the appeal the Big G has to audiences.

After all, it’s damn entertaining to watch a giant monster stomping around the streets of a metropolis and leaving a path of destruction. Sure, American movies like King Kong and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms primed American audiences for features of this magnitude. But really, it was Godzilla and the evolution of the IP’s unique genre of films — kaiju eiga (Japanese for monster movie) — that perfected the formula, took it internationally, and captured fans across multiple generations. That fanbase, mind you, even includes revolutionary filmmakers like John Carpenter, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese.

And like the impermeable lizard, there’s no slowing down this franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is currently expanding Legendary’s MonsterVerse on Apple+ with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to touch down April 2024. That’s not all, either. Toho returned this weekend with their critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One, the highly anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Shin Godzilla. To celebrate, Bloody Disgusting went ahead and ranked every live-action Godzilla title from the beginning until now. It’s quite a feat given the monster-sized back catalogue, but here they are: 34 features in all their stomping, roaring glory.

A latchkey kid named Ichiro spends most of his days alone, avoiding his bully, and left to daydream. His favorite place to escape to is Monster Island, where he imagines he is friends with Godzilla’s son Minilla who also faces his own problems with bullies in the form of a monster named Gabara. The sole Godzilla movie created with children as the primary audience in mind falls prey to the worst of TV show trope: the clip show. A mashup of recycled monster footage from several previous Godzilla films, All Monsters Attack is mercifully short and has a strong message about standing up for yourself … but it’s a slog to sit through.

Americans had waited for years to take a crack at a Godzilla movie for themselves. Numerous scripts (including one penned by the folks who wrote 1992’s Aladdin) and directors were attached (including Speed and Twister heavy Jan de Bont). Sadly, what we finally ended up with was this flaming pile of garbage that’s more of a sendup to Independence Day and Jurassic Park than a proper Godzilla movie. This has even led to the monster shown being dubbed as Zilla in fan circles. It’s totally devoid of any kind of social commentary or metaphors that make many of the other movies work and misappropriates the monster as overgrown pest that just wants to eat fish all day. Despite all of that, Godzilla was a huge hit at the box office and directly responsible for an increase in his popularity stateside to a whole new generation of moviegoers.

The idea that Godzilla movies are mindless — just men in rubber suits wrestling — owes a great deal of that stereotype to Godzilla vs. Megalon. The film received a wide theatrical release in the US and was the first Godzilla title to receive a prime time broadcast by NBC that was hosted by John Belushi. What’s it about? Recent nuclear tests have disturbed the lost city of an Atlantis-like underground civilization dubbed Seatopia. As punishment, they send their fearsome monster Megalon, a giant cockroach with drills for arms, to punish mankind’s destructiveness. The film was made with one of Toho’s smallest budgets, and it shows with its barren country side battles and the rehashing of old special effects.

What if Godzilla had a son? The title tells you everything you need to know about this one, and marks the first appearance of the turd-looking progeny of Godzilla, aka Minilla. A government research outpost is stationed on an island where they hope to test a new weather control system that will hopefully combat the effects of global warming. Godzilla plays the strict parent here who seems annoyed at his wimpy son’s inability to do anything — including being picked on by some of the other monsters who live there like a giant spider and some mantises. It cannot be stressed enough how truly terrible the creature design for Minilla is in this movie.

In a world where Godzilla intermittently threatens Japan over the decades as they advance their energy capabilities, a section of the Japanese Defense Force called the G-Graspers is created to combat him. Their idea to rid the world of his presence is a new piece of technology called the Dimension Tide, which can fire localized black holes from a satellite. As you would expect, this device inadvertently opens a portal to a previous era and the giant armored dragonfly, Megaguirus, is unleashed on Japan. This movie raises some interesting questions about the responsible use of nuclear energy and has some pleasing popcorn moment fights, but fails to stand up to any kind of logic with its large leaps in science.

Godzilla 2000 marks the beginning of the ‘Millennium Era’ of Godzilla movies, where each cite only the 1954 as canon and the rest are disregarded. The Godzilla Prediction Network seeks to track Godzilla’s landfall patterns to learn more about his habits and study his behavior. Meanwhile, an inert UFO that is millions of years old is found deep in the Japanese trench and comes to life to unleash an alien plot and take over the world. It’s hard not to see some of the fears of Y2K present here, but the film suffers from some drawn-out action scenes and poorly-aged CGI effects.

The first of five Showa Era movies directed by Jun Fukuda, Ebirah, Horror of the Deep marks the period in which Godzilla starts to enter more silly and campy adventures. There is little nuance to the titular monster, a giant lobster engaged in battle with Godzilla where they are hitting rocks back and forth like two tennis players volleying for a point. Ebirah’s action all takes place on an island where the terrorist group Red Bamboo has enslaved local inhabitants to manufacture a chemical made from local fruit that can ward off the crustacean’s attacks. Godzilla feels out of place in this movie, though, which makes sense considering the original script had King Kong in his place instead.

Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. is a rarity among these movies as it serves as a direct sequel/part two to Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, in addition to 1961’s Mothra. Mechagodzilla, called Kiryu in the Millennium Era and built using the bones of the 1954 Godzilla, is under repairs after its previous square off with Godzilla. The Mothra twins arrive, telling them that Godzilla will continue to attack Japan unless they return the bones to their original resting place, a common theme in several of the Millennium Era titles. Mothra’s usage is the highlight here and serves as a point to strengthen its underlying message of working together to overcome obstacles.

Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is a wildly uneven movie and the low point in the otherwise strong Heisei Era of movies. Sure, there’s some good stuff in the form of the creature design like SpaceGodzilla, as well as Godzilla’s adopted and adorable son, Little Godzilla, but the movie suffers from a bloated plot and scenes that stretch on for far too long. The premise here is that some of Godzilla’s cells have found their way into space and mutated with an asteroid that is barreling towards Earth, which leads to his doppelganger crash landing in Japan and Godzilla’s son being kidnapped. There are some underlying themes about genetics and biology, but they’re … flimsy to say the least.

One of the major complaints about Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla is that there weren’t enough monster scenes. King of the Monsters responded to this by letting them eat cake and fight ’til the proverbial curtain drops. To do that, the movie adds some of Godzilla’s most beloved foes with Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah all joining the party. There’s a flipside to that coin, though: One of the things that stands in the way of all giant monster melees is the overwrought human plot about ecoterrorists and kaiju mind control devices. And that’s what happens here as the humans merely exist to spout off exposition and lack any kind of real depth to their performances. Still, some mindless good fun is had here.

Aliens coming to Earth and pretending to be friendly but secretly having ulterior motives of world domination is an all-too-common plot device in this franchise. Godzilla vs. Gigan tries to add a new wrinkle by having it take place around a theme park, which serves as a secret base to destroy Godzilla. Themes of false prophets and consumerism are explored with plenty of ham on its fist. Even so, there’s a silver lining in Godzilla’s newest foe, Gigan, a space alien with scythed claws for hands, a buzzsaw in his tummy, and a red laser for an eye.

Much like the inhabitants of Japan following the end of World War II, so too are the people who exist in the world of Godzilla. Together, they’re trying to restore order and balance to their lives following the events of his attack on Tokyo in the 1954 original. The prevailing theme here is having faith on your fellow man, not in institutions like the government or military. Not a bad story, either: This entry follows two airmen that work as spotters for a fishing company to show them where to trawl their nets. While they’re out flying, they make a discovery: You guessed it! It turns out there’s another Godzilla … only this one has a friend in Anguirus, introducing the Godzilla versus another monster formula to the series.

Ghosts of the past returning to haunt the present pulls double duty in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Still dealing with the death of her commander and fellow soldiers from a past battle with Godzilla, pilot Akane must confront the beast once again using the giant robot Kiryu, which utilizes bones from the original Godzilla’s body. During a battle with present day Godzilla, however, Kiryu goes haywire and something primal takes over when Godzilla’s roar awakens memories of the past. Akane must face her own history to save the day, ultimately becoming one of the strongest female leads written in the series.

Marking the end of the Millennium Era, Godzilla: Final Wars is sheer opulence. The premise is simple: What if we brought back as many of Godzilla’s old foes as possible and had them fight? And also toss in aliens for good measure? What comes to fruition is an out-and-out action movie featuring karate, an original song by Sum 41, and as many callbacks and cameos to the entire history of Toho’s kaiju catalogue. There’s really nothing below the surface to explore in Final Wars, but damn if it isn’t a wild good time.

Yoshimitsu Banno only directed one Godzilla movie, but he created what is perhaps the most unique of them all. The psychedelic Godzilla vs. Hedorah is part LSD trip and part commentary on the state of environmentalism. The monster Hedorah, a literal embodiment of smog and pollution, oozes around the screen like a nasty ichor leaving behind a trail of destruction and skeletons in its wake. Humanity has done a poor job keeping the Earth clean, so Godzilla decides it’s up to him to take out the trash. Note: This movie is also famous for being The One Where Godzilla Briefly Flies Using Atomic Breath.

One of the biggest changes to the way people consumed media between the 1950’s and the 1960’s was the accessibility of TV at home. King Kong vs. Godzilla is a commentary on this burgeoning landscape of consumerism. A pharmacy company is disappointed with the shows they’re sponsoring, but after hearing a tip about an ape monster living on one of the nearby Faro Islands, they decide he should be captured to help boost ratings. As the title suggests, Godzilla appears and the two biggest titan brands you can think of do battle. This movie is played for laughs so it is beyond silly, but Akira Ifukube’s driving score is one of the strongest in the entire series.

Light versus dark is a tale as old as time. Godzilla vs. Mothra employs this metaphor by unleashing Mothra and her chromatically opposite-colored doppelgänger Battra on each other and Godzilla as he threatens to destroy everything. Nature fighting back against the hubris of man is the unifying theme explored and only through the power of working for the greater good can things be resolved. It’s a movie about transformations and the shifts both Mothra and Battra take from their larval forms that speak to man’s ability for personal growth in the face of adversity.

Godzilla is back, so Japan develops a Mechagodzilla using parts of the destroyed Mecha-King Ghidorah to try to stop him. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II‘s ruminations on the dangers of artificial intelligence have aged quite well given the present times we all live in. This movie also features the introduction of Baby Godzilla, whose adoptive mother is a member of the G-Force who possesses telekinetic powers. All of this sets the stage for some payoffs in the following two Heisei Era movies.

The Return of Godzilla marks the beginning of the Heisei Era and the first onscreen appearance of Godzilla in nine years. Hoping to shed some of the reputation of the sillier titles displayed in the Showa period, we’re treated to a soft reboot of the series which trades the nuclear bomb and post-World War II sentimentalities of the original and adapts them to the looming threats of the Cold War. Despite offers of aid from the Soviets and the US to stop Godzilla — especially after he has attacked submarines of their own — Japan decides to handle the problem themselves as these offers of aid come with the strings that nuclear force will be used. There is a growth and maturity to this film that would come to be hallmarks during the ’80s and ’90s movies.

America takes another crack at making Godzilla and the results mostly succeed. Gareth Edward’s direction leaves the movie with an impressive sense of scale. The metaphors of the original are updated to modern American sensibilities and a timely reference to the Fukushima nuclear accident lends itself as in interesting plot point to some of the monsters’ origins. The dawn of the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is lacking for onscreen monster time but the action sequences that do pop up start the era off nicely.

The final film of the Showa Era, Terror of Mechagodzilla serves as a mature coda to the initial series. It finds Godzilla squaring off against Mechagodzilla yet again, in addition to the giant dinosaur Titanosaurus. Terror is more of a global affair than most because it sees a marine biologist teaming up with Interpol to take down both a mad scientist and an alien race called the Simeons who have created a mind control device that threatens to destroy Earth and its protector, Godzilla. This would also mark the final films of director Ishiro Honda and composer Akira Ifukube, signaling the end of the classic Godzilla period.

Japan has discovered the mysterious Planet X and sends astronauts to explore it. Upon arrival, they are shocked to discover it’s home to an alien race called the Xiliens who face constant terrorization by King Ghidorah and are forced to live below the surface to survive. They propose a trade and offer humans a miracle drug that will cure all disease if they send Godzilla to defeat King Ghidorah. As per usual with these movies, the aliens have ulterior motives in mind. Predictable as that story may be, there is some deep charm to the movie’s retro-futuristic look. Of course, it’s also the first omen that this series would become sillier and sillier, much thanks to the victory dance Godzilla does after fending King Ghidorah off. Just skip that part.

The human characters of the MonsterVerse have all been relatively paper thin. Godzilla vs. Kong combats this with success by adding King Kong to the fold, who serves as its most well-developed character to date. His friend, a young deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), and her adoptive mother Doctor Andrews (Rebecca Hall) are standouts as well. There’s a breezy, quick pace to this movie as it moves from one set piece to another while the action sequences are well designed and drenched in color. More of a King Kong vehicle than a Godzilla one, Godzilla vs. Kong sees old foes reunited in imaginative and fun new ways.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah marks the first and only movie to feature a time travel plot, which it utilizes to great success. Humans from the far future travel back to Japan in the present day, pleading for help to defeat Godzilla who has wrought havoc on the world. Their mission is to go back further in the past and prevent Godzilla from being mutated. As always, there’s a catch, and upon returning, King Ghidorah is now the main threat to humanity. The science is shaky, but the monster battles in this are some of the best the Heisei Era has to offer.

Despite being responsible for many of the weaker Showa Era titles, director Jun Fukuda finally hits paydirt with Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. An imposter Godzilla is on the loose, creating havoc and destroying cities. Of course, this imposter is revealed to be none other than Mechagodzilla. With the help of King Ceasar, Godzilla must take down his most powerful enemy yet. Mechagodzilla works well thanks in part to its mystery elements, jazzy score, and well-written human plot. It’s dripping with interesting lore and has several memorable fight scenes, both human and monster.

After escaping from a plane that is moments away from detonating in an assassination attempt, a mysterious woman claiming to be from Venus appears with a warning that monsters will soon be appearing. This is the first Godzilla movie to feature the big guy teaming up some of his fellow kaiju and transforming from villain to Japan’s protector. Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster is full of awesome city-destroying set pieces and the reveals for each monster — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah — are exceptionally memorable. Bonus: The theme of working together to solve problems makes this title a real stand out.

Originally slated to be the end of the Showa Era, Destroy All Monsters is set in the near future in a world where all of Earth’s kaiju have been corralled to Monster Island, all so humans can take care and study them. Unfortunately, aliens arrive and take over the island, releasing them across the globe through the use of mind control. Soon, an all-out monster melee transpires in a battle of good versus evil. This movie is extremely hopeful in its gaze to the future, a world where mankind comes together for the greater good. This is peak Saturday morning matinee fare, and one of the best Showa Era releases.

Godzilla movies usually follow a set of unwritten rules where Godzilla is painted as more of a tragic figure than straight up malevolent. In Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, we finally see a Godzilla that is truly evil and kills mercilessly. He serves as an excellent metaphor to the atrocities committed during World War II by Japan. The chickens have come home to roost and Godzilla is angry. We also have King Ghidorah playing against type as a protector of Earth. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah is the best of the Millennium Era and pure monster chaos.

Themes of genetics and human’s ability to bend nature to its will are explored in Godzilla vs. Biollante. After splicing cells from Godzilla’s body with a rose and some cells from his deceased daughter, a scientist inadvertently creates the giant flower monster Biollante, which angers Godzilla and sets them up for a showdown. There’s a fun subplot involving a nefarious organization hoping to procure some of the Godzilla cells for their own diabolical purposes and the ensuing cat and mouse game that transpires amongst the monster chaos unfolds nicely. Godzilla vs. Biollante muses on the responsibility we have to use science for good … and it’s great.

After a mysterious egg washes up on shore during a tsunami, a wealthy tycoon seeks to buy it and build a theme park around it. As always, Godzilla appears, and it’s up to Mothra to protect her soon-to-be-born progeny. Mothra vs. Godzilla is a simple story about corporate greed, environmentalism, and friendship told well by screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, who would collaborate on many of the Showa Era movies. It features some of the best characterization the era has to offer and establishes Mothra as symbol of good.

Godzilla Minus One follows the story of failed kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and his return home after narrowly escaping an attack by a giant dinosaur at the end of World War II. Japan is in ruins and at is most vulnerable following the events of the war. A few years later, nuclear testing mutates the creature into Godzilla and he sets his sights on Japan. Minus One features the strongest characters in the entire franchise and deals with heavy themes of survivor’s guilt. The sense of scale is breathtaking, and the scenes of destruction play out to alarmingly good levels. The Reiwa Era of Godzilla movies is off to an incredible start with this latest release.

A giant misshapen creature comes ashore in Tokyo, soon laying waste to all things in its path. As it stumbles and slinks along the city, it slowly starts to rapidly evolve into the Godzilla we all know and love in response to the obstacles it faces. On top of some incredible monster action, Shin Godzilla‘s strongest points are its exploration into the government’s response to such a disaster and the red tape that must be traversed. We see the full chain of command on display — warts and all — and it’s a refreshing plot line with no other comparison in the franchise. Godzilla is a literal force of nature in this one and at his scariest.

The final title in the Heisei Era, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is its most impressive and succeeds on both human and kaiju levels. Godzilla has transformed into Burning Godzilla after ingesting too much nuclear energy and is set to meltdown like a nuclear reactor with enough devastating force to destroy the world. If that weren’t enough, the big guy squares off against the demonic-looking Destoroyah, a monster mutated by the effects of the oxygen destroyer that defeated the original 1954 Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the ultimate culmination of good versus evil in the Godzilla series.

Director Ishiro Honda’s masterpiece serves as a transcendent metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war and the scars it left on Japan following World War II. Godzilla stands tall as a tragic figure and invokes powerful imagery of the destruction the nation felt during the fire bombings of Tokyo and the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is no finer example of a Godzilla movie than the original, and it lays the foundation for all others that would follow. The iconography on display is truly moving.

Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in a theater near you. Don’t go away, though! Below, you can read our exclusive interview with director Takashi Yamazaki.

One of the most interesting things I’ve learned while reading about Godzilla this month is Toho’s mentorship program and the way they nurture and cultivate talent from within. I was curious how your previous experience working on Shin Godzilla played a role in this movie. 

Takashi Yamazaki (TY): [Laughs.] Actually, I wasn’t directly involved with Shin Godzilla, but the company I was at was involved with it. However, because we were working at the same company and I knew the same VFX folks from Shin Godzilla, I got to recruit some of them. They did a lot of great work on the destruction scene as well as the tanks. I was happy I got to recruit them in this instance. It was fantastic.

Speaking of the visual effects, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sense of scale. You have a lot of angles from the ground looking up that allow the viewer to take in this giant force and the destruction being inflicted. The aerial shots invoke some of the ’80s and ’90s era films too. What were your influences to create this effect? 

TY: I wanted to capture the audience’s awareness of their surroundings and that does help especially from some of the airplane shots and the biggest emphasis was to be close to Godzilla’s face. Because there’s so much detail and there’s a lot of fear that comes out of that. For example, when [Shikishima’s] in the plane or the train is in [Godzilla’s] mouth, the trick was we had to switch the POV from the train to Godzilla’s face because we’re at the closest point.

For something like when [Godzilla’s] in the ocean, he just pops out so that’s not such a big deal. That’s why we have those news reporters on the building so we’re rather close to his face as much as possible. Also, I had a hand in creating Godzilla the Ride at Seibuen Park in Japan. I wanted to recreate the experience of seeing Godzilla in your face.

There’s a really strong theme of survivor’s guilt and that’s something we haven’t seen in any of the other 30-plus movies. Why did you decide to go that angle with this story? 

That had a very specific purpose. First of all, it’s part of the weight [Shikishima] is carrying emotional baggage, so to speak, and also we get to see everyone fighting against a calamity, in this case Godzilla. I was really tipping the hat back to Godzilla’s original metaphor which was to represent war and nuclear weapons and all these humans are trying to overcome him. I thought it was interesting that since Godzilla represents war, you have someone who essentially has PTSD and all this guilt from going to war. That’s what he’s battling against. To to make peace with his guilt.

There’s a ton of homage to 1954’s Godzilla. We touched on the rooftop reporter sequence, which is almost shot for shot for the original and same for the train scene. On top of that, you have a good amount of Akira Ifukube’s music in there. How do you feel your work here expands upon the original?

I feel like in 2023, now that we have so much more digital technology, the key was to create a Godzilla you feel like can exist, especially again, with how close you are to Godzilla and his details. So with 1954, it’s classic that Godzilla chomps on the train, but we never know what happened. What about the people in the train? What’s their experience?

In my version, we watched the reporters die, but in the 1954 version, you couldn’t do that. They just didn’t have that technology to do so. We’re in the 21st century, so now we have the digital tools to be able to look at these individual experiences that we weren’t able to see in that original version. And also, yes, Ifukube-san’s music It’s synonymous to Godzilla like the 007 theme song [is to James Bond]. We were very, very specific about when the famous Godzilla theme song should come come up when choosing that moment.

I would have to say the original 1954 Godzilla. Right off the bat when it came out, Godzilla already had the Godzilla qualities. No one had to add to that war anymore. And plus, on top of that, the human story and the war-torn, wounded, and hurt people then having to overcome Godzilla. So all of those three elements: the human story, the war, and Godzilla, everything was together and worked so great in the first movie. So great.

"[Review] Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, 'Just Monika' Dengan Ekspansi Wholesome",Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/07/review-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-just-monika-dengan-ekspansi-wholesome/,"Kita kembali ke tahun 2017, lebih tepatnya pada tanggal 22 September ketika gim visual novel karya Team Salvato, Doki Doki Literature Club atau disingkat sebagai DDLC dirilis untuk pertama kalinya dan langsung menjadi hit bagi para gamer dan pecinta visual novel.

Bagaimana tidak? Itu semua berkat unsur horor psikologis yang bersembunyi dibalik plot cerita yang santai serta enjoyable, atau yang paling terkenal yakni sang ""Heroine Utama"", Monika yang mampu 'mengacak-acak' isi gim itu sendiri berkat sikap self-awareness dan kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang dia miliki. Sebuah konsep yang sebenarnya tidak biasa pada suatu visual novel tapi berhasil menarik perhatian bagi para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel, bahkan saya sendiri yang bukan merupakan penggemar genre visual novel ikut tertarik dengan gim ini dan menemukan bahwa gim ini jadi exciting bagi sebagian orang berkat 'unsur kejutan' di dalamnya.

Oke, kata ""exciting"" ini mungkin agak kurang tepat karena sesuai dengan apa yang saya tulis di paragraf sebelumnya. DDLC sangat menonjolkan unsur horor yang menargetkan pada masalah psikologis, terutama bagi para remaja, yang mana sangat terlihat sekali pada ceritanya bahwa paranoid, depresi, dan gangguan kepribadian merupakan ""senjata tidak terlihat"" yang sangat ampuh dalam mengubah perilaku seseorang. Nevertheless, it's still a very nice game to be explored. 

Empat tahun setelah kehebohan ""Just Monika"" menggema, secara mengejutkan Dan Salvato mengumumkan bahwa DDLC hadir kembali! Merupakan hasil kolaborasi antara Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge, DDLC hadir kembali sebagai Doki Doki Literature Club Plus atau disingkat sebagai DDLC+, yang merupakan ekspansi dari gim orisinalnya. Tidak hanya sebagai 'angin segar' bagi yang sudah memainkan DDLC, namun juga bagi yang ingin mencobanya untuk pertama kali.

Jika ada satu hal yang perlu dipertanyakan, maka itu adalah harga. DDLC+ sendiri dibanderol Rp. 95.999 (diskon 10% menjadi Rp. 86.399 hingga 9 Juni mendatang saat artikel ini ditulis) untuk sebuah gim yang awalnya free-to-play, dan masih tersedia di Steam sampai sekarang. Untungnya Team Salvato dan Serenity Forge punya alasan kuat untuk menjustifikasi hal tersebut. Pertama, DDLC+ hadir dengan penambahan fitur dan segudang konten baru dalam jumlah masif. Kedua, DDLC+ kini hadir di platform konsol, termasuk Nintendo Switch. Faktanya sendiri merasa yakin kedua alasan tersebut lebih dari cukup untuk menjustifikasi harga yang dibanderolnya.

Apakah segala penambahan fitur dan konten baru meyakinkan baik bagi sudah memainkan DDLC maupun bagi yang memainkannya untuk pertama kali? Saya sebagai MedForSquad dan juga penggemar DDLC akan menjawabnya untuk kalian.

Ketika kalian menjalankan DDLC+, kalian akan menjumpai sebuah booting screen, lalu kalian mendapati sebuah desktop screen yang terlihat seperti Microsoft Windows.... tunggu, memangnya DDLC+ punya desktop screen sendiri? Jawabannya iya, sepertinya karena Team Salvato tidak ingin mengubah DDLC orisinal secara besar-besaran hanya demi mengakomodasi semua fitur dan konten baru. Sebagai gantinya mereka menempatkan gim utama beserta semua konten baru secara terpisah ke dalam sebuah 'wadah' tersendiri dalam bentuk desktop ala Windows. Kalian dapat menikmati semua konten baru tersebut tanpa perlu menjalankan gim orisinal di dalamnya.

Tentu saja semuanya ditempatkan di sini. Anda ingin melihat semua CG dalam game ini? Ada pictures yang menyediakannya untukmu. Rindu dengan BGM dan lagu tema ""Your Reality"" oleh Monika? Ada inbuilt music player yang bisa kalian dengarkan di sana. Lalu yang paling utama adalah side stories yang akan saya jelaskan pada sub-bab selanjutnya. Last but not least, adalah files yang tentu saja... kalian harusnya sudah mengerti apa harus dilakukan dengan gim ini, bukan begitu?

Memang penempatan gim utama serta konten ekstra dalam sebuah desktop terasa membingungkan untuk pertama kali, tapi saya rasa ini adalah sebuah good execution jika kalian ingin memainkan gim utamanya demi mendapatkan semua konten demi mendapatkan sebuah 'kepuasan' dalam mengeksplorasi gim ini.

Salah satu intisari utama dari DDLC+ adalah keberadaan side stories sebagai bagian tersendiri dari gim utama. Mungkin kalian sebagai penggemar DDLC bertanya-tanya, bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk? Bagaimana pertemuan pertama antara Monika dan Sayori? Bagaimana Yuri dan Natsuki memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub? Hal itulah yang selalu menjadi diskusi hangat bagi para penggemar DDLC. Untungnya Team Salvato menjawab keinginan tersebut dengan menghadirkan cerita sampingan tersebut.

Side stories sendiri terdiri dari enam bagian untuk masing-masing pasangan serta satu stories tersendiri untuk keempat heroine. Semua cerita sampingannya didedikasikan untuk cerita tersendiri tanpa keterkaitan dengan cerita utama. Tidak ada unsur horor seperti pada gim utamanya, hanya sebuah cerita yang menjelaskan perjalanan bagaimana klub literatur terbentuk dan bagaimana mereka bertemu untuk pertama kalinya. Bagi penggemar berat DDLC, mungkin ini adalah sesuatu yang menggembirakan dan side stories adalah apa yang mereka harapkan. Setiap ceritanya sendiri well-written, emosional, dan yang paling terpenting, it's definitely wholesome. Setiap karakter pada setiap cerita memiliki porsi cerita yang seimbang satu sama lain, lengkap dengan CG baru yang menampilkan masing-masing pasangan. Oh iya, adanya beragam trek musik baru yang ditambahkan khusus untuk side stories terasa sangat pas dengan momen tersebut, membuat ceritanya semakin menghayati bagi yang membacanya.

Pada di akhir side stories, jelas tergambar bagaimana para heroine memiliki sebuah ikatan yang sangat kuat dan menyentuh hati. Sesuatu yang sangat kontradiktif dengan cerita utamanya tapi setidaknya kalian bisa mengerti bagaimana mereka bisa saling dekat satu sama lain.

Spoiler Alert: Khusus sub-bab ini akan menyinggung plot utama dari gim orisinal Doki Doki Literature Club. Jika kalian belum pernah memainkan gim ini maka disarankan untuk langsung loncat ke bagian kesimpulan. Membaca sub-bab ini maka artinya kalian menerima untuk diberikan spoiler cerita dari Doki Doki Literature Club.

Jika kalian sudah paham dengan peringatan di atas, kita akan mulai dengan mengingat kembali premis dari DDLC orisinal.

Cerita dimulai dari seorang karakter tanpa nama (kita akan sebut sebagai ""MC dari sini) yang diajak Sayori, teman masa kecilnya si MC untuk mengajak bergabung dengan klub literatur bersama dengan tiga anggota lain, Yuri, Natsuki, dan Monika sang ketua klub. Awalnya enggan, namun akhirnya MC memutuskan untuk bergabung ke klub literatur karena tidak ingin membuat mereka kecewa.

Melihat sebagai sebuah kesempatan untuk lebih dekat dengan para heroine, MC pun menulis puisi yang dianggap bisa memikat mereka. Kalian akan memain suatu mini-game untuk menuliskan puisi tersebut dengan cara memilih kata-kata yang mereka sukai. Kalian bisa mengetahuinya dengan melihat reaksi mereka sesuai dengan kepribadian masing-masing. Contohnya Yuri yang menyukai kata-kata yang kompleks, berlawanan dengan Natsuki yang menyukai segala sesuatu yang ""imut"", dan Sayori yang menyukai kata-kata yang emosional, seperti senang atau sedih.

Begitulah sebagaimana jalan cerita dari DDLC sejauh ini, plot yang sebenarnya biasa saja, bahkan untuk ukuran standar visual novel sekalipun. Namun, para penggemar yang sudah memainkannya sejak gim orisinalnya dirilis pun sudah tahu bahwa ini sebenarnya hanyalah sebuah ""tip of an iceberg"", merupakan awal sebelum semuanya jadi serba salah.

Sebagaimana progres cerita berlanjut, kalian akan mendapati bahwa para heroine mulai menunjukkan tanda-tanda masalah psikologis serius yang membawa pada kejadian yang tidak terduga dan momen-momen menakutkan yang semakin sering terjadi. Tidak hanya para heroine, gim sendiri pun mulai 'rusak' dengan munculnya berbagai glitch, tampilan karakter yang berubah tanpa alasan yang jelas, alur dialog yang mulai kacau dimana-mana, dan munculnya berbagai puisi misterius yang menyeramkan. Semuanya tersebut menjadi satu sebagai momen breaking the 4th wall yang mana membuat MC harus bertindak dengan mengubah isi file gim yang sudah di luar kendali tersebut.

Sejauh ini DDLC+ tetap mempertahankan experience layaknya versi orisinal. Selama memainkan gim ini, saya tidak melihat adanya perubahan drastis pada cerita utamanya. Bagi saya (dan mungkin penggemar DDLC), ini merupakan hal yang bagus karena tetap membawa pengalaman mencekam seiring dengan kalian mendalami gim ini. Semuanya tetap terasa seperti aslinya, terutama jika kalian telah lama tidak memainkan DDLC, dan setiap pilihan yang kalian buat akan tetap terasa worthwhile.

Hal yang lain tentu saja berbagai momen-momen mencekam yang bisa kalian nikmati sepanjang jalan cerita dalam gim ini, seperti puisi terakhirnya Sayori, leher Natsuki yang tiba-tiba saja patah, atau Yuri yang langsung menikam dirinya sendiri begitu saja setelah menyatakan perasannya. Sejauh apa yang saya mainkan, entah kenapa momen-momen tersebut terasa lebih 'hidup' dibandingkan ketika memainkan gim orisinalnya, mungkin karena Team Salvato sendiri telah meningkatkan visual dari gim orisinalnya. Pada akhirnya, memang semuanya mencekam layaknya genre horor psikologis, tapi tetap terasa seperti memainkannya untuk pertama kali bahkan bagi yang sudah memainkan gim orisinalnya sekalipun. Just like it was and it's still memorable as it was.

DDLC tetaplah DDLC seperti ketika dirilis pertama kali empat tahun yang lalu, tetap menjadi visual novel favorit para gamer maupun pecinta visual novel dengan unsur horor yang kreatif, serta plot cerita yang begitu memorable bagi banyak orang. Gim seperti DDLC ini sangat disarankan jika kalian menginginkan suatu elemen 'kejutan' dalam sebuah visual novel.

Lalu bagaimana dengan imbuhan ""Plus"" pada DDLC+? Jelas ""Plus"" merupakan ekspansi tersendiri dengan menambahkan imbuhan 'bumbu' tersendiri yang menambah daya tarik dari gim orisinalnya secara keseluruhan melalui side stories  yang brilian. Belum lagi penulisan ceritanya yang sangat menyentuh hati, yang mana dapat membuat kita menjadi lebih memahami bagaimana arti dari suatu ikatan antar para heroine tersebut.

Pada akhirnya, apakah DDLC+ worthed it? Tentu saja, bahkan jika kalian bukanlah penyuka visual novel sekalipun, saya akan tetap merekomendasikannya. Kalian adalah penggemar DDLC? Maka DDLC+ adalah no-brainer bargain for you, and ""Just Monika"" is the justice.

Kangen Monika? Team Salvato Umumkan Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!,Media Formasi,29 bulan lalu,https://mediaformasi.com/2021/06/kangen-monika-team-salvato-umumkan-doki-doki-literature-club-plus/,"Masih ingat dengan Monika? Atau mungkin kata mutiara favorit kita semua yaitu “Just Monika”? Tentu saja kita masih mengingat itu semua ketika game Doki Doki Literature Club pertama kali dirilis pada tahun 2017 dan langsung menjadi kehebohan bagi para gamer berkat unsur horor psikologis yang tersamar dalam bentuk visual novel yang imut, serta tentu saja Monika, sang 'heroine utama' yang dirundung masalah self-awareness, serta kemampuan breaking the 4th wall yang seolah-olah menyadari keberadaan kita sebagai pemain, bukan sang karakter utama dalam game itu sendiri. Tentu saja seram tapi di saat yang sama juga mendapatkan simpati dari para gamer, menjadikannya sebagai sebagai ‘waifu’ favorit mereka.

Empat tahun setelah game orisinal DDLC dirilis, Team Salvato bersama Serenity Forge secara mengejutkan bahwa ekspansi dari game orisinalnya yaitu Doki Doki Literature Club Plus (DDLC+) diumumkan secara resmi.

Dan Salvato menjelaskan bahwa DDLC+ akan membawa berbagai konten baru meliputi side stories, yakni cerita sampingan yang menjelaskan bagaimana persahabatan dari para heroine di klub literatur terbentuk.

Slay the Princess Review — Hit the Slay button - Checkpoint,Checkpoint Gaming,6 hari lalu,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/11/slay-the-princess-review-hit-the-slay-button/,"Released just in time for Halloween, Slay the Princess is a haunting visual narrative that gives you one simple task: slay the princess held captive inside a cabin in the woods. What starts as a simple instruction quickly disappears down a twisted rabbit hole in this existential horror visual novel, featuring powerful voice performances and a few simple design tricks that heighten the experience into one of the most creative narratives this year.

Visual novels are one of my favourite gaming genres, but even I must admit that they are sometimes a bit of a slog to get through. That’s why VNs with unique twists that defy expectations of the genre like Doki Doki Literature Club, hold a special place in my heart. Slay The Princess can now be added to that list.

Exactly why this princess deserves death is a mystery — the narrator, who is not just a storytelling device but an actual character in his own right, pointedly refuses to tell you, and gets increasingly cagey the more you question him. The sketchy hand-pencilled art style ingeniously makes it impossible to guess whether the Princess’s huge, darkly-lined eyes are those of an unhinged maniac, or simply those of a tortured victim.

As you might have already guessed, whether or not you initially choose to slay the princess is just the tip of the iceberg. The story will quite quickly evolve beyond your wildest imaginations into an existential time-looping adventure that pits you against the same starting point again and again. It’s very impressive that so many branches can come out of so simple a beginning: each choice you make has the potential to drastically change the story. There are more than 25 routes in total, each one separated into up to four chapters bookended by your character’s death. When you die, you reawaken outside the cabin again, and the narrator prattles on like nothing has changed…. but it has.

Even seemingly innocuous choices can change the outcome of your route, so it’s a great incentive to play through it again and again. The routes can get extremely dark at times, and players who have trouble with depictions of gore may wish to tread cautiously. But there are plenty of comedic moments too, as you and the narrator bicker and argue about events as they happen. After going through about 5 routes, the game will lead you to one of a few endings where you get to learn what it all means.

Perhaps the most unconventional part of this narrative is that the Princess’ very nature is changed depending on your choices. If you treat her as a suspicious person, she is suspicious. If you treat her as a foe to fight and overcome, she is skilled at combat and will try her best to kill you. If you treat her as an innocent victim, that’s exactly what she is — and always was. The versions of her are not always so literal, though; she can transform in ways that are more allegorical or metaphorical than that, but they always seem to hark back to how you’ve treated her.

Far from being a writing flaw, these inconsistencies are part of the story Slay the Princess is telling. It’s pretty existential, and it took me multiple playthroughs for it to fully sink in, but it’s well worth it.

The voice performance by Nicole Goodnight is convincing in all her versions of the Princess, even if her strong American accent is a little jarring against the English Jonathan Sims’ performance as the Narrator and all other voices.

Each time you progress to a new chapter, a new voice will be added to the chattering inside your head, like unseen angels and devils talking in your ear. They are given names like The Voice of the Stubborn, the Voice of the Paranoid, and so on, but their exact nature depends on how you’re likely to feel after the events of your last time loop.

Of course, the game can’t truly know how you feel, but it was surprisingly astute at guessing in my case. In my first loop ever, I sided with the Princess over the suspicious narrator and tried to free her, causing the narrator to try to sabotage our escape. When this inevitably resulted in my death and the next loop began, The Voice of the Skeptic chimed in to announce his complete distrust of the narrator, which mirrored my own feelings perfectly. It happened again when I trusted the Princess only to be betrayed: afterwards, The Voice of the Cheated expressed how unfair it all was.

These Voices, and their arguments with themselves and the narrator, are a common comedic break among the otherwise dark themes. With that said, their chatter can begin to get tiresome when it goes on for too long. Later chapters and loops can sometimes feature three or more Voices, who can argue with each other for what feels like minutes, and I began to skip over them before long.

As a pure visual novel with no gameplay beyond choosing options, Slay the Princess has a few little flourishes that make the game stand out. The entire game is illustrated in rough pencil sketches, which adds to the creepiness of the tale and leans into being a twisted fairy tale. It keeps the visuals interesting by utilising line boiling, an animation technique that makes linework seem to wobble or jitter in place, as well as cool parallax effects that put a bit of movement into otherwise still backgrounds. It also makes for a distorted, twitchy look that fits the game’s atmosphere perfectly.

Another great touch is the cursor, which is a clawed hand that changes to reflect whether or not you are currently holding a dagger — and whether or not it has drawn blood.

Slay the Princess is an entertainingly dark and subversive visual novel with hidden depths that makes for a great few hours. For developer Black Tabby Games’ second title, it’s a very encouraging success indeed, and proves that its horror-telling chops in Scarlet Hollow wasn’t just a fluke. I will be keenly looking forward to its next title.

If it isn't video games, Edie doesn't care about it. She's been playing games since the N64 era, and only spent enough time away from her 3DS to earn a Bachelor in Games Design from RMIT.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! di PlayStation Memiliki Sensor di Sejumlah Scene - Indozone Game,Indozone Game,28 bulan lalu,https://game.indozone.id/e-sport/961047565/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-di-playstation-memiliki-sensor-di-sejumlah-scene,"Doki Doki Literature Club kini menjadi salah satu game visual novel bergenre horor yang sangat populer di PC. Dan kini Team Salvato selaku pengembangnya sudah menghadirkan versi Plus! dari game ini yang tersedia untuk platform console.

Tetapi baru-baru ini Team Salvato mengumumkan bahwa khusus untuk game Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! yang diluncurkan di PlayStation, terdapat sedikit perbedaan yang dihadirkan dari platform lainnya yaitu terdapat sejumlah sensor di scene tertentu.

Seperti yang kita ketahui, DDLC sendiri memiliki scene yang bisa dibilang cukup sadis untuk dilihat. Maka dari itulah kemungkinan sensor ini dihadirkan agar game ini tidak melanggar aturan yang diterapkan oleh Sony.

""Perubahan yang dihadirkan sebenarnya tidak terlalu signifikan. Kami ingin penggemar mengetahui hal ini terlebih dahulu sebelum mereka menyadari jika ada perbedaan dengan game aslinya. Saya juga tak ingin pemain mengira jika perubahan tersebut dilakukan karena paksaan oleh perusahaan lain,"" ucap Team Salvato melalui blog resminya.

Salah satu scene yang mendapatkan sensor adalah ketika seorang karakter di game tersebut yang memilih untuk menusuk dirinya sendiri sehingga terdapat darah yang memancar. Nantinya darah tersebut akan hadir dengan warna abu-abu ketimbang merah.

Buat kalian yang belum pernah memainkan Doki Doki Literature Club, kini kalian bisa mencoba versi Plus!-nya yang bisa kalian beli dan mainkan di platform PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, dan Nintendo Switch.

Game Dewasa Doki Doki Literature Club Rilis Konten Baru,KINCIR.com,46 bulan lalu,https://kincir.com/game/pc-game/game-dewasa-doki-doki-rdckoripnqb3/,"Enggak semua game ramah buat banyak orang. Kehadiran game dewasa juga bisa dinikmati sebagai sajian yang cukup menarik. Pasalnya, ada tema yang cukup nyeleneh dan bikin ketawa-ketawa sendiri kalau kita ikuti. 

Tengok saja kehadiran Doki Doki Literature Club yang rilis pada 2017 silam. Game bertema visual novel ini punya jalan cerita yang bikin pemainnya geleng-geleng. Enggak banyak adegan sex dalam game ini. Pasalnya, pemain juga hanya dituntut menikmati jalan cerita dalam balutan visual novel yang mirip sama komik hidup ini. 

This will be the year I reclaim my happiness so I can deliver it to others! My goal is to fully return to doing things I enjoy, such as making games. First releasing new DDLC content (not a sequel), then blowing the dust off my next original VN which has been on hold for 2 years.

Nah, kabar gembira buat kalian yang mengikuti game ini, pasalnya sang pencipta Dan Salvato bakal merilis konten baru untuk Doki Doki Literature Club. Dalam sebuah cuitan di akun Twitter resminya tersebut, Dan Salvato bakal memberikan konten anyar dari Doki Doki Literature Club. 

Belum jelas apakah konten baru yang dimaksud ini bakal berupa downloadable content (DLC) atau justru spin-off dari game ini. Yang pasti, Dan Salvato mengonfirmasi kalau ini bukanlah sekuel sehingga enggak ada game Doki Doki Literature Club 2. 

Kehadiran konten baru ini tentu saja menarik. Pasalnya, game tersebut terkenal punya cerita yang ""nakal"". Para pemain bakal dihadapi pilihan sulit untuk memilih teman perempuan serta masuk pada masalah hidup mereka.

Doki Doki Literature Club is an uncontrollably horrific visual novel,Polygon,73 bulan lalu,https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/22/16512204/doki-doki-literature-club-pc-explained,"During the fall season, I spend a lot of time searching for fresh scares. I’m immune to haunted houses and horror movies, because neither one force me out of my comfort zone. I know that movies will progress without my input; even if I’m shrinking back a bit in my seat, it’ll keep moving, and I can live out the full experience. As for haunted houses, with the exception of a few “intensified” experiences, ghouls can’t touch me, and the scares are predictable. I can round a corner and, well, gosh! It’s … a dude in a costume and usually some pretty cool makeup. 

I often feel the same sense of ease when playing horror video games. Gore doesn’t irk me, and monsters are so yesterday. I've already seen my fair share of Resident Evil 7 Let's Plays without feeling much in my gut. Like I do with haunted houses and horror films, I always know that none of the scares are real. 

But a romantic visual novel, of all things, petrified me recently — just by completely subverting my expectations. It exploited my confidence in the visual novel genre and turned that into a twisted game of its own. It taught my nightmares new tricks. 

Although it looks like a dating sim, Doki Doki Literature Club is a free-to-play, psychological horror game, produced by indie studio Team Salvato. Since its release, the game has earned a reputation as an innovative scare. It’s a slow burn that begins with you and group of cute girls who must prove that their literature club is worth becoming an official school organization. Of course, your protagonist is hoping to forge new bonds with some of them along the way. The game encourages you to pick a girl to write a poem for, and depending on your choices, you may draw closer to the club’s charming, sweet members. 

Eventually, true to the game’s advertised content warnings (which you should take seriously, by the way), Doki Doki Literature Club leads you down a dark path, leading to the shocking and emotional death of one character. But in the same moment that it rips your heart open, the game instantly takes a much more unusual twist. 

After this initial playthrough ends and the main menu restarts, the dead character’s image is pixelated and warped, as if her death affected the game client itself. The save files become inaccessible, forcing the player into a new game. If and when the player moves ahead to begin this new file, the game seems to react at any hint of this former character, and the client loudly glitches and morphs until it seems satisfied with its outcome. 

Soon into the next run-through, the client repeatedly takes control of itself, speeding through text and tacking on unusual images to create grotesque jump scares. But the reality of a sentient game client becomes nightmare fuel on its own.  

To make matters worse, in the moment of the character’s death, keen eyes will notice that the game directs the player outside of the client by naming a specific game file, alluding to an outside force changing the game’s universe. It becomes a terrifying mystery, weaving in and out between the in-game plot and the game files’ cryptic implications: What happened to Doki Doki Literature Club?  

As I crawled into this “second run,” I wasn’t just horrified; I was mentally trapped in the game's world and its antics. But I still wanted to dive back in, and I spent time with myself to understand what I had to overcome in order to continue the game. In the process, I realized how Doki Doki Literature Club utilizes an underrated aspect of the horror experience: control, or the lack thereof. 

On a basic level, the fear of fear (the anticipation, in a word) is what makes horror as a genre so difficult for many people. In interactive media, you’re especially aware of how you’re prompting the horrors by progressing through the work. Worse, a game can mask the world around you in highly efficient ways, bringing down your guard before a good scare. You can start crawling into a space before getting dragged out, or you can open a door that seemed safe before and encounter a new monster. The point of many games becomes, then, that fear often makes you lose control, and just as often, loss of control makes you lose the game. 

The “action-adventure horror house” is an effective and proven genre, with tactics such as jump-scares, claustrophobic encounters and high-adrenaline chases that work despite their tired use. Developers have learned how to capture the traditional horror atmosphere and drive tension in such an efficient way that even the aforementioned classic methods are amplified in these settings. 

Doki Doki Literature Club uses many of these same familiar concepts, but not in the way you’d expect, and that’s mostly thanks to its breakdown of the fourth wall. Known as “metafiction,” this genre of work is explicitly designed to restructure the dynamic between the work and the person interacting with it. In this case, it almost entirely removes control from the player. 

It’s worth noting that metafiction already has huge potential in horror games, because of their inherent nature of directly interacting with the player. This isn’t supposed to happen in a video game, right? The window isn’t supposed to exit, that file wasn’t there before, is that character addressing me? It creeps into and mocks our imagination and ideas of what that game is supposed to be, and that quickly gets under players’ skins. Much like horror, a primary theme is control. 

As a work of horrific metafiction, Doki Doki Literature Club quite literally overwrites that control, taking the tropes of metafiction, horror and visual novel genres and amping them up a few notches. It builds moments based on what is assumed to be your understanding of the genre’s tropes and the fundamentals of interactive media. There are ominous text files appearing out of nowhere; a “bonus poem” unlocked by the player in this new run-through can either be a sweet “I love you” or a dark regret of our former character. “Scenes” I expected to be cute are overlaid with static and blacked-out eyes, and characters sometimes zoom in with uncomfortable closeness. The game knew that I knew this wasn't normal, and it used that as a tool to make me uneasy.  

More importantly, it kills a character, then explicitly prevents you from doing anything about it. I expected to return to your save file to rescue her or maybe date another girl, but I was not allowed to. She was gone. When the game restarts, it constantly mocked my decisions and regrets. I wasn't given any idea of how fix the universe, short of a hard reset on the game altogether — which would only bring me back to square one.

In sum, this is what’s horrifying about Doki Doki Literature Club: You, as a player and a character within the game’s world, are helpless. 

As I dug into the game’s newly-warped world, extra poems and the suddenly-appearing game files, my grasp of the game slipped further. The quest to discovering the game’s secrets becomes a paradox, because as much as I wanted to know more, the process untangles the universe further and further. And, when that realization sunk in, I became less sure what the goal was. All I could do was move forward and find some light at the end of the tunnel. (Well, hopefully.) 

Team Salvato has unearthed a new way of terrifying us by ripping apart our expectations of how interactive media should work. Doki Doki Literature Club is a game that played me, and somehow, I'm content to let it take control.

E3 2021: Doki Doki Literature Club Plus Announced; Coming to Consoles and PC June 30th,Jump Dash Roll,29 bulan lalu,https://www.jumpdashroll.com/article/e3-2021-doki-doki-literature-club-plus-announced-coming-to-consoles-and-pc-june-30th,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, as well as the various PlayStation and Xbox consoles on June 30th.

A psychological horror game with an incredible anime twist, the trailer for this upgraded version of the game closes with the phrase: âThis game is not suitable for children or those who are easily disturbedâ. So donât be fooled by its cutesy exterior (blimey - ed.).

A modern cult classic, Doki Doki Literature Club originally launched on PC via Itch.io before coming to Steam. The âPlusâ version of the game not only brings it to consoles for the first time, but also updates the game with extra side stories, new music, HD art and more.

A deluxe edition of the game was also announced, which contains a lot of physical extras related to the game. The deluxe edition will be available later in the summer.Â

Started with the PlayStation, now I'm here... with a PlayStation. Once skipped school to play the Metal Gear Solid demo repeatedly. I love stories big and small. Trophy hunter. Recent VR convert. Probably a hipster.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! Sells half a million copies,KitGuru,28 bulan lalu,https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/mustafa-mahmoud/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-sells-half-a-million-copies/,"Doki Doki Literature Club was a surreal and genre-bending freeware visual novel released all the way back in 2017 for PC and was met with great enthusiasm across the industry. Now, nearly 4 years later, the expanded version of the game, which costs money, has sold over half a million copies.

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! launched on the 30th of June across all major platforms. Less than a month after release, the game has already been purchased over 500,000 times, with the game’s creator Dan Salvato saying “I’ve had the opportunity to hear from so many fans about their experiences with Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, especially the new Side Stories. We’re all brought together through connecting with the club members and relating to their everyday challenges. It inspires us to take on our own challenges and be our best selves. It means so much to me that I can make a difference in that way, and I hope our feeling of closeness will never have to subside. I’m eternally grateful for it.”

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! adds a whole lot of new content over the original game, including a visual upgrade, six new side stories, 100 unlockable images, 13 new music tracks and a music player.

Considering the fact that this new version does not bring with it any significant new content to the mainline game, it is pleasantly surprising to see so many copies sold in such a short amount of time. Of course, with the game previously only being available on PC, it would be interesting to see the platform breakdown of DDLC Plus!
